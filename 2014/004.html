In general, results demonstrate inspiring metaphors related to the personal assistance system, e.g. "like an airbag…" or "like a family member…", which might be useful for future interface designs and approaches of communication in the context of smart home environments. However, no relation of anthropomorphism and trustworthiness could be found. Therefore, we suggest an anthropomorphic threshold, which should be investigated by using an improved method and trust scale.</i></p>

<h2>1. Introduction</h2>

<p align="justify" style="text-indent:19.85pt;">  Smart environments in a medical context provide a wide range of
services that support people in their everyday lives [1], assist in sustaining
the autonomy and quality of life of older adults [2] and further more help, in
the long run, to limit the cost of medical care. While at the same time the
highly technological features of smart environments, like for example sensors,
do not necessarily impose themselves on the user as they are in many cases
hardly noticeable. As a matter of fact, smart environments collect a vast
amount of information, which "has led to growing
concerns about the privacy, security and trustworthiness of such systems and
the data they hold" ([3], p.1). Hence, attention should
be shifted to these determinants in order to ensure a positive usage behavior [4,
5, 6, 7].</p>

<h4> 1.1. Trust
as a Critical Factor </h4>

<p align="justify" style="text-indent:19.85pt;">  Several research frameworks, a for example the Ubiquitous Computing
Acceptance Model [8] and Technology Acceptance Model for Mobile Services [9],
underline the critical role of trust in smart environments. The Ubiquitous
Computing Acceptance Model (UCAM), in which the concept of trust plays a
central role, explains (a) how privacy, security and trust are linked to one
another; and (b) how trust is related with usage intention. Shin [8] considers
"trust […] as an antecedent variable to attitudes" (p.173). Subsequently
attitudes are positively linked with behavioral intention. Additionally, the critical
role of trust on usage intention was already mentioned by Kaasinen [9] who
developed the Technology Acceptance Model for Mobile Services (TAMM) as a
modification of Technology Acceptance Model (see [10]). TAMM puts the focus on
trust and ease of adoption "that affect the intention to use" ([9], p.71). In
the following we will use trust as a combination of
positive beliefs in the technology, provider and reliance of the system [9, 11].</p>

<H4>1.2. Anthropomorphism
and Users' Trust</H4>

<p align="justify" style="text-indent:19.85pt;">  If we want to understand users' trust towards smart home
environments, we have to consider the mental models, which users have of such
environments. However most striking, when first getting involved with mental
models, is the fact that there does not seem to be a unified terminology. Further
in the field of human-computer interaction several approaches have been applied
to infer what mental models users hold e.g., observing users while interacting
with the system [16], gathering performance data [13], think-aloud protocols [14],
teach-back data [15, 16] or metaphor and analogy [17]. The later might be
useful to investigate how users perceive a technology. For instance perceiving a
technology could include human-like characteristics that one "features to
animals, computers and religious entities" ([18], p.1). This would hint at so
called <i>anthropomorphic</i> mental models. Thus the description can be
classified by where the perception is located on a bipolar scale with a
spectrum reaching from <i>human </i>to <i>technical/artificial. </i>Research of
how anthropomorphism is related to the general user experience of smart environments
has just started in recent years [18]. </p>

<p align="justify" style="text-indent:19.85pt;">  With regard to<i> trust</i>, it is worthy to analyze the
anthropomorphic characteristics of mental models and relate them to the perceived
trust in a system. Kiesler et al. [19] examined how humans create a mental
model of a (humanoid) robot. The authors report when people show
anthropomorphic characteristics in their mental models of a system they tended
to perceive the system as more trustworthy. In the field of smart medical
technologies, e.g., Pak et al. [20] reported trust building effects of
anthropomorphic characteristics on a diabetes decision-making support aid.
Therefore, we expect that users might perceive a system as more trustworthy, if
their mental model contains anthropomorphic characteristics.</p>


<h4> 1.3.
Purpose of the Study and Logic of Empirical Procedure </h4>

<p align="justify" style="text-indent:19.85pt;">  Given the specific characteristics of smart home environments, we
have to include trust as a critical factor, which might determine the intention
to use smart home applications. As mentioned above trust might be influenced by
the perceived anthropomorphism of a technology. Several previous studies have
underlined the importance of taking mental models into account. However, a
detailed literature review revealed that little is known about mental models in
smart home environments. In order to better understand mental models (in terms of
anthropomorphic attributions), this article tries to answer how anthropomorphic
perception of smart home environments is related with trustworthiness. </p>

<p align="justify" style="text-indent:19.85pt;">To investigate
our research question two studies have been conducted: </p>

<p align="justify" style="text-indent:30pt;">1. The
aim of the first study (<b>Study A</b>) was to explore, if users might include
more or less human-like characteristics in their mental model of the smart home
environment.</p>
<p align="justify" style="text-indent:30pt;">2. In
the second study (<b>Study B</b>) we relate human-like attributions with trustworthiness
of smart home environments.</p>

<h2> 2. Study A: Exploration of Mental Models </h2>

<H4> 2.1.
Method </H4>
<h4> <I>2.1.1.
Material</I> </h4>
<p align="justify" style="text-indent:19.85pt;">  Today, it is well known that mental models develop best through
feeling and actively experiencing a technical system (see, e.g., [21] or [22). Therefore,
we invited participants into the Future Care Lab [24, 25] (Figure 1), a
simulated intelligent home environment at the RWTH Aachen University [23]. Participants
were invited to experience and interact with a personal assistance system for

heart patients, which was developed in the project "eHealth – Enhancing
Mobility with Aging" [27]. The project aimed at developing a "personal
assistance system, which enables elderly patients to maintain their mobility
and independence despite their chronic diseases and advanced age" ([16], p.1). The
evaluation scenario included interactions with two different smart homecare
applications (see [16] for more details).</p>

<br>

<h4> <I>2.1.2.  Procedure</I> </h4>

<p align="justify" style="text-indent:19.85pt;">  The study was divided into four main parts. With regard to the
research question addressed in this paper, we will focus our description on the
interaction with the smart environment and the interview. First, participants
answered a pre-questionnaire, which contained questions regarding different
user characteristics. Second, each participant interacted with a home-monitoring
application (see Figure 2), which was designed for patients suffering from
end-stage heart failures. </p>

</figure>
<br>



<p align="justify" style="text-indent:19.85pt;">  Third, participants had to answer a short post-questionnaire
regarding their attitude towards the experienced system. Finally, within the
interview section, we explored prevalent mental models, i.e., users' perception
of smart home environments using the teach-back method. During the interview participants
were asked to describe a metaphor or analogy of the previously tested sample
application. To ensure a comprehensive understanding of reported metaphors, participants
were required to "explain similarities between the scenario and the metaphor or
analogy" ([17], p. 435). While most metaphors are little distinctive,
participant could generate more than one metaphor and were asked to report
which metaphor fits best. Based on the metaphor and analogy, we expected to
receive better insights, how participants perceive technology [29].</p>

<p align="justify" style="text-indent:19.85pt;">The interviews (40-50
minutes) were audio-recorded and quotations were translated from German into
English. The script was pretested. </p>

<h4> <i>2.1.3.
Participants</i> </h4>

<p align="justify" style="text-indent:19.85pt;">A total of 12
participants (<i>N</i><sub>1.1…1.12</sub>), six young adults between 19 and 34
years (<i>M</i> = 27.8, <i>SD</i> = 5.4) and six older adults between 48 and 71
years (<i>M</i> = 60.3, <i>SD</i> = 7.5) took part in the study. The sample was
balanced with respect to gender. Most of the older adults belonged to the
active part of the workforce and could be regarded as quite healthy. The group
covered a broad range of professions, including teachers, economics, clerks, computer
scientists and psychiatrists). The majority of participants reported extensive
experience using such information and communication technologies (negative
skew). At the same time, all participants reported to be inexperienced in using
medical technologies. Our
participants – invariably German native speakers – were recruited by the
authors' existing social networks.</p>


<h4> <i>2.1.4. Coding Scheme</i> </h4>

<p align="justify" style="text-indent:19.85pt;">As expected,
users provided mental models in a variety of formats (e.g., verbal descriptions,
sketches and drawings). Fifteen teach-back interviews were transcribed fully verbatim.
As we were interested in perceived anthropomorphic characteristics within the
language and metaphor of smart home technologies, a coding scheme was developed
using a bottom-up approach. Two independent raters
reached an inter-rater reliability of .87 on coding scheme <i>anthropomorphism
within language</i> and .84 on coding scheme <i>anthropomorphism in metaphor</i>.</p>

<p align="justify" style="text-indent:19.85pt;">In the
following, we first describe how responses were coded with regard to the degree
of anthropomorphic attributions expressed within the language (<i>anthropomorphism
within the language</i>) and then within the metaphor (<i>anthropomorphism in metaphor</i>).
Each rater analyzed the degree of anthropomorphic
characteristics in two stages. First, the rater read the answers to get an
impression of how the participant verbalized technical processes. Second, the
rater coded anthropomorphic attributions along three ordinal categories:</p>


<p align="justify" style="text-indent:30pt;">1.<i> Technical/non-anthropomorphic</i> language/metaphor e.g., "electrodes are connected via LAN to the display" or "like a flat screen with data storage possibilities" 
(low degree of anthropomorphic attribution)</p>
<p align="justify" style="text-indent:30pt;">2. <i> Technical/non-anthropomorphic, rudimentary human-like</i> language/metaphor e.g., "the system receives my data and sends my information to a physician" or "like an airbag… which cares about me." (medium degree of anthropomorphic attribution)</p>
<p align="justify" style="text-indent:30pt;">3. <i>Anthropomorphic, rudimentary technical</i> language/metaphor e.g, "I am data provider" or "like a physician who checks my blood pressure at home." (high degree of anthropomorphic attribution)</p>


<h4> 2.2. Results</h4>

<p align="justify" style="text-indent:19.85pt;">The analysis of
transcripts showed that the answers of participants differed concerning their anthropomorphic
characteristics used while talking about technology. Three participants attributed
remarkable human-like characteristics to the technology (<i>anthropomorphic,
rudimentary technical) </i>e.g., <i>"the computer understands this…</i>"(N<sub>1.12</sub>),
"<i>for the computer, I am just a provider of data"</i>(N<sub>1.4</sub>) or "<i>he
[i.e. the pressure sensor of the scale] sent data…"</i>(N<sub>1.5</sub>). At
the same time the descriptions of three participants were classified as <i>technical/non-anthropomorphic,
rudimentary human-like</i>. Six participants showed <i>technical/non-anthropomorphic
</i>characteristics. </p>

<p align="justify" style="text-indent:19.85pt;">  When asked to provide a metaphor of the personal assistance system, participants
generated various metaphors, which we categorized according to the degree of
anthropomorphism. The most frequently extracted category was <i>technical/non-anthropomorphic
(N = 7) </i>(e.g<i>., "… a library, where data in the form of books and folders
is stored, administered and accessed." [N<sub>1.8</sub>]). </i>Respectively,
two participants represented a <i>technical metaphor with rudimentary
human-like characteristics </i>(e.g.,<i> "… an airbag, which is invisible, but
cares about me and protects me, if an accident occurs." [N<sub>1.3</sub>]" </i>and
two participants described the assistance system with an <i>anthropomorphic metaphor
</i>(e.g., <i>"… a family member, who takes cares of me, knows me and my
habits." [N<sub>1.4</sub>]</i>.</p>

<p align="justify" style="text-indent:19.85pt;">We expected that participants with an anthropomorphic
language might generate a more anthropomorphic metaphor. Results have shown
that a higher degree of anthropomorphism within the language is associated with
a higher level of anthropomorphism in the generated metaphor (<i>r </i>= .71; <i>p
</i>&lt; .05, Spearman rank analysis). Participants who used more human-like
characteristics to describe the technology tended to generate a more human-like
metaphor. </p>


<h4> 2.3.
Interim Conclusion </h4>

<p align="justify" style="text-indent:19.85pt;">  The first study aimed at identifying prevalent mental models of
smart home environments. By analyzing the linguistic characteristics
and the metaphor, we extracted human-like attributions in the mental models. Results
showed that users have different perceptions of smart home environments with
regard to the degree of anthropomorphic characteristics, e.g., <i>"he [the
pressure sensor of the scale] sends data…"</i>(N<sub>1.4</sub>) and, <i>"the
computer understands this…"</i> (N<sub>1.8</sub>). Further, we found that more
human-like characteristics within the language were positively correlated with
a more human-like metaphor. That means, if a participant used a human-like attribution
when answering, this was associated with a more human-like characteristic of
the metaphor. Consequently, we can confirm Hänke's [30] impression that
metaphors are an effective and inspiring way to overcome the abstract and
difficult character of computer systems.</p>

<p align="justify" style="text-indent:19.85pt;">However, we have
to limit this observation. Despite the fact that both coding schemes reached
acceptable reliability scores, correlations of anthropomorphism in language and
metaphor only occurred when using ratings of one rater. Scanning the second
rater showed no significant results. Nevertheless, the results of the first
study confirm those of Kynsilehto and Olsson [18] who
found that anthropomorphism might play an important role for the perception of
users in the field of smart home environments. </p>


<h2>3. Study B: Association
of Anthropomorphism and Trust </h2>

<p align="justify" style="text-indent:19.85pt;">  In the previous study, we explored how users perceive the tested
smart home environment with respect to anthropomorphic attributions. This study
aims at verifying our prior investigations of how mental models appear (as
perceived anthropomorphism). Furthermore, the study tries to answer how
human-like attributions are associated with trustworthiness. In this context,
we expect that participants who attribute more anthropomorphic characteristics
to smart home environments (represented in the metaphor) have lower trust
concerns.</p>

<h4>3.1.
Method </h4>

<h4> <i>3.1.1.
Procedure and Material</i> </h4>


<p align="justify" style="text-indent:19.85pt;">  Similar to the first study, we used the same test application,
components and structure (see Study A for details). In addition, we developed
an extended post-questionnaire, which focused on attitudes regarding smart home
environments. Participants were asked to rate bipolar statements referring to
their attitudes such as privacy, security and trust on continuous rating scales.
</p>

<p align="justify" style="text-indent:19.85pt;">  Linguistic experts proved comprehensibility and wording of the post-questionnaire.
Filling out the questionnaire required approximately 15-20 minutes, while the
entire session lasted for about 40 minutes in total. </p>

<h4><i>3.1.2.
Variables</i> </h4>

<h4> <i>3.1.2.1. Independent Variable: Anthropomorphism
in Metaphor</i> </h4>


<p align="justify" style="text-indent:19.85pt;">As illustrated
above, we were especially interested in the perception of the personal
assistance system. Therefore, participants had to generate and explain a
metaphor or analogy of the system, which we classified according to the degree
of anthropomorphism. The attributions were analyzed according to the previously
developed coding scheme (see section 2.1.4).</p>


<h4> 3.1.2.2. Dependent Variable: Trust
(T)</h4>


<p align="justify" style="text-indent:19.85pt;">As smart
environments collect and use information of a user, trust is likely to be an important
issue. We define trust as a combination of positive beliefs in the technology,
provider and reliance of the system e.g., "I would not trust the information of
the system" [9, 11]. A high trust score (max. 10 points) indicates high
concerns with regard to the perceived trust.</p>

<h4> <i>3.1.3.
Reliability and Validity of Scales</i> </h4>


<p align="justify" style="text-indent:19.85pt;">Prior to the
analysis of data, scale reliability and scale validity of questionnaires were verified.
Few items had to be excluded since they did not achieve the criteria. Almost
all reliabilities of scales were extraordinarily high and indicated internal
consistence of scales. In detail the Cronbach's Alpha value was .85 for trust. Using a principal component analysis with varimax rotation (Kaiser
Normalization), we analyzed convergent
and discriminant validity. Therefore, we can conclude that all items loaded on
correct latent constructs. Finally, six factors were extracted, which explained
81.9% of the variance. </p>

<h4> <i>3.1.4.
Data Analysis</i> </h4>


<p align="justify" style="text-indent:19.85pt;">Twenty-four
interviews were transcribed verbatim and analyzed using the previously
developed coding scheme for metaphors (see section 2.1.4). Q-Q plots and
boxplots indicated that the assumptions of parametric tests were met. Therefore,
data was analyzed by independent sample <i>t-</i>test. As anthropomorphism in
the metaphor occurred in the form of a dichotomy, we used Pearson correlations as
an equivalent to the point-biserial coefficients (cf. [31]). The significance level for <i>t-</i>tests was set to p &lt; .05. </p>

<h4> 3.2.
Results </h4>

<h4> <i>3.2.1.
Participants</i> </h4>

<p align="justify" style="text-indent:19.85pt;">In total, <i>N</i>
= 24 persons (<i>N</i><sub>2.1…2.24</sub>) between 19 and 76 years (<i>M </i>= 45.4;
<i>SD </i>= 22.1) participated in the study.  The participants came from a
broad range of professions (e.g., medicine, economics and engineering) and had
no prior experience in using smart environments. The sample was balanced with
regard to gender and almost all participants reported to be in good health
conditions. Generally, older participants showed lower experience with
information and communication technologies compared to younger participants. Although
the experience in using medical technologies was generally low, older
participants reported a higher experience in contrast to younger participants.</p>


<h4> <i>3.2.2.
Anthropomorphism</i> </h4>


<p align="justify" style="text-indent:19.85pt;">Four responses had
to be classified as invalid. Due to these invalid responses, the variable
became dichotomous (1=<i>technical/non-anthropomorphic metaphor</i> and 3=<i>anthropomorphic
metaphor</i>), which had to be considered in the statistical analysis (see section
3.1.4). Finally, asking to provide a metaphor generated a bimodal distribution
of responses. 45% of the mentioned metaphors were classified as technical/non-anthropomorphic
metaphors </p>

<h4> <i>3.2.3.
Trust</i></h4>


<p align="justify" style="text-indent:19.85pt;">The overall
ratings show that participants tended to perceive the presented home-monitoring
system as trustworthy (<i>M </i>= 30.9; <i>SD </i>= 25.8; <i>Mdn </i>= 29.0). With
regard to more specific aspects of trust, the results indicate that participants
even have trust in the system when processes are invisible (<i>M </i>= 3.7; <i>SD
</i>= 2.7; <i>Mdn </i>= 2.5). Most participants also reported that they feel to
be well taken care of (<i>M </i>= 3.7; <i>SD </i>= 2.7; <i>Mdn </i>= 2.5). In
contrast, answers with regard to the personal confidence in the stability of
the system did not show a clear tendency (<i>M </i>= 5.1; <i>SD </i>= 3.1; <i>Mdn
</i>= 5.0). </p>


<H4> <i>3.2.4.
Association of Anthropomorphism and Trust</i> </H4>


<p align="justify" style="text-indent:19.85pt;">In addition, <i>t</i>-tests
were performed to analyze whether the degree of anthropomorphism is related
with trust (the anthropomorphism in metaphor was treated as the independent
variable). Our initial assumption was that people who include anthropomorphic
characteristics in their mental representation judge the system as more
trustworthy. In order to validate this hypothesis, two-tailed <i>t-</i>tests
and Mann-Whitney <i>U</i> tests were used to investigate whether trust was related
with the degree of anthropomorphism. Contrary to our expectation, no
significant difference could be found. Trust did not show significantly different
item and scale ratings between non-anthropomorphic and anthropomorphic
metaphors. Therefore, our initial hypothesis could not be supported. To double check
the result we compared the degree of anthropomorphism with trust using Pearson
correlations, which confirmed the prior results. </p>


<H2>4. General Discussion </H2>

<p align="justify" style="text-indent:19.85pt;">In this section,
the outcomes of both user studies are discussed with respect to the question of
whether users include human-like attributions to smart home environments and
whether this humanizations is associated with trustworthiness.</p>


<H4> 4.1.
Anthropomorphic Attributions </H4>

<p align="justify" style="text-indent:19.85pt;">We analyzed participants'
mental models regarding a more or less anthropomorphic perception of the tested
personal assistance system. On one hand, the teach-back methodology encouraged
participants to talk about technology. On the other hand, the metaphor helped
to overcome the abstract and difficult character of the smart environment. Both
methodologies made it possible to extract human-like characteristics, either
within the language or as a characteristic of the metaphor.</p>

<p align="justify" style="text-indent:19.85pt;">In the first
study, we gathered anthropomorphic attributions to technology within the
language (e.g., "<i>for the computer, I am just a provider of data"</i>(<i>N</i><sub>1.4</sub>)
or "<i>he [the pressure sensor of the scale] sends data…"</i>(<i>N</i><sub>1.5</sub>)).
Here anthropomorphic characteristics within the language were associated with
anthropomorphic characteristics of the metaphor.</p>

<p align="justify" style="text-indent:19.85pt;">Focusing on
metaphors, we gathered several inspiring metaphors, which might be useful for
future interface designs in the context of smart home environments. Moreover,
the generated metaphors might be implemented in instruction manuals or used for
supporting target-group-oriented trainings. Interestingly, when users were
asked to generate a metaphor of the personal assistance system, some did not
refer to the technology, but to the room itself, e.g., "<i>a library, where
data in the form of books and folders is stored, administered and accesses</i>"
(<i>N</i><sub>1.8</sub>). This could be explained by the fact that due to the
invisible integration of the technology, participants primarily perceived the
room and were not aware of the technology. </p>


<H4> 4.2.
Association of Anthropomorphic Perception and Trustworthiness </H4>

<p align="justify" style="text-indent:19.85pt;">  In a second step, we tried to answer the question, how mental models
are influencing attitudes such as trust. Focusing on our hypothesis with
respect to human-like perception of the personal assistance system (expressed
in the metaphor), we received results contradicting the ones of Kiesler et al. [19]
as well as Pak et al. [20]. The perception of anthropomorphic characteristics
in the mental model (represented in the metaphor) did not increase the
trustworthiness of the technology. There might be two possible explanations for
the missing association of anthropomorphic perception and trustworthiness. </p>

<p align="justify" style="text-indent:19.85pt;">The first explanation refers to the
appropriateness of the metaphor as methodology. As a result of the metaphor the
coding scheme was appropriate to analyze the degree of human likeness. However,
the measure scale finally reduced the participants' perception on a dichotomous
scale, which might not be sensitive enough to differentiate the <i>real </i>perceived
anthropomorphic perception. By using other methods, like for example Language
Analysis, Repertory Grid Technique [32] or Semantic Differential [33] we might
have had develop a more differentiating scale. This might help to increase the
chance to detect any influence of anthropomorphic perception on
trustworthiness. In addition, such an alternative scale would be applicable for
differential diagnostic statistical testing procedures (e.g. analyses of
variance). For further studies a more precise methodology and measure scale is
recommended to help assess the anthropomorphic perception of smart home
environments and to differentiate the responses in more detail. </p>

<p align="justify" style="text-indent:19.85pt;">The second
explanation refers to smart home environment as a research object. Although
participants reported human-like associations in the metaphor, the system was
not perceived as more trustworthy. Kiesler et al. [19] as well as Pak et al. [20]
have investigated systems, which provoked a high degree of anthropomorphism. In
our study, we required to generate and explain a metaphor or analogy of the
personal assistance system, which is much more complex and less concrete
concerning human-like characteristics and therefore allowing less
anthropomorphic associations. </p>

<p align="justify" style="text-indent:19.85pt;">This leads us to
the assumption that participants' trustworthiness will not remarkable increase
until a certain <i>anthropomorphism threshold</i> of human likeness is reached.
As Figure 3 illustrates, we assume a non-linear relation of anthropomorphic
characteristics and trustworthiness. Our personal assistance system (left side
of the figure) might not have reached the critical trust increasing threshold
of human likeness. Therefore, anthropomorphic association in the metaphor was
not associated with participants reported perceived trustworthiness. Mori [34]
described that familiarity of a technology (e.g., a robot) might increase until
a specific point of anthropomorphism of the robots is reached, which creates a
point of uncertainty, whether technology is human or not human, termed as <i>uncanny
valley </i>(right side of the curve). Based on our results we suggest combining
Mori's approach of an uncanny valley (assessing familiarity) with our
explanation of an anthropomorphism threshold (assessing trust). </p>

<h4> 4.3. Future Research</h4>

<p align="justify" style="text-indent:19.85pt;">The studies
presented in this paper helped to gain first insights into anthropomorphic
representations of smart home environments. However, we could not show any
relation of anthropomorphism and trustworthiness. Consequently, some
limitations need to be addressed in future research.</p>

<p align="justify" style="text-indent:19.85pt;">One limitation
refers to the sample. Especially in study one we tested only 12 participants.
Based on this we correlated anthropomorphism in
language and metaphor. To underline that both methods (teach-back and metaphor)
are depending and comprehensive, future studies should
test a larger sample an Furthermore, only German citizens were tested. Other
cultures might have a different view on technology (see, e.g., [35, 36, 37].
Therefore, results provide only tendencies of insights about mental models of
users and their relations to trust.</p>

<p align="justify" style="text-indent:19.85pt;">A second limitation
refers to metaphor as a method, which seem to be an oversimplification to
assess anthropomorphic perceptions. An alternative method should be applied,
which is more suitable to assess more nuanced individual differences in
anthropomorphic perception. Especially the
investigation of how a participant abstracts technology in general might be
promising in order to better understand how anthropomorphic characteristics are
built in the users' head. This will lead to more comprehensive
knowledge about the relationship of anthropomorphism and trust. </p>

<p align="justify" style="text-indent:19.85pt;">In addition, future
studies should use an improved trust scale, since reliability and factor
analyses reduced the number of items. As a result, the provided information
covered just a small excerpt of our intended constructs. Additionally, the item
scoring polarity should alternate. This could increase variance as participants
might make use of the entire continuous rating scales and to raise the attention
of participants. </p>


<h2>5. Final Conclusion </h2>

<p align="justify" style="text-indent:19.85pt;">The relation of
anthropomorphic perception and its relation with trustworthiness remain an
unanswered question. Backed up by earlier research (see, e.g., [18, 19, 20]) it
seems worth to investigate the relation of anthropomorphism and trust in the
field of smart home environments. We suggest an anthropomorphic threshold,
which should be investigated by using a more precise methodology and scale. Still
metaphors are an effective and inspiring way to
overcome the abstract and difficult character of computer systems. </p>
