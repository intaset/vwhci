    <p class="body"><b>Abstract</b> - <i>Web server log files are an inexpensive, automatically captured recording of a user experience (UX) on a website. In this paper, a tool, UX-Log, used logfiles to recreate users' experiences with the purpose of gaining usability insights. To evaluate the effectiveness and value of this, 10 usability experts watched recreated user experiences using UX-Log and were then asked to infer users' goals, strategies, successes or failures, and proficiencies; and afterwards, rate UX-Log across multiple dimensions. Both user experience recreation and UX-Log proved successful for gaining usability insights; usability experts were able to infer users' goals, strategies, successes or failures, and proficiencies. They were able to do this without training, without familiarity of the website, and without domain knowledge of the subject depicted in the user experiences. However, they were only able to infer users' overarching goal, not specific goal criteria, and were only able to determine relative proficiencies after viewing both user experiences. They also expended a good deal of mental effort trying to comprehend ambiguous user interactions, and identified needed improvement in the UX-Log interface.</i></p>

<h4>1. Introduction</h4>


<p class="body">  With the increasing use
of [1] and dependence on websites [2], it is important that websites
demonstrate good usability; defined as "[the] extent to which a system, product
or service can be used by specified users to achieve specified goals with
effectiveness, efficiency and satisfaction in a specified context of use" [3]. Two
common methods for understanding the usability of a website are <i>usability
testing</i> and <i>web analytics.</i></p>

<p class="body">  In usability testing, <i>individual</i>
users are observed and studied while interacting with the website [4]. Although
it is a popular method, usability testing requires planning; can be expensive
and time consuming; and may not provide results that accurately represent <i>all
usage</i> [5].</p>

<p class="body">  In contrast, Web analytics
uses recordings of user interactions (logfiles) to report on and graph <i>aggregate</i>
website usage [6]. For example, when used on an e-commerce website, Web analytics
can provide tables and graphs depicting website traffic and popular product
pages. Unlike usability testing data, logfiles are automatically generated,
inexpensive to use, and reflect <i>actual usage</i> [6]. However, Web analytics
fails to convey <i>individual usage and behaviour</i> [7], which are important
for understanding website usability, e.g., <i>why</i> and <i>how</i> a user navigates
to a product.</p>

<p class="body">  The research described
in this paper proposes a new method for understanding website usability and an alternative
use of logfiles, i.e., using logfiles to recreate a user's experience on a
website for the purpose of understanding individual usage and behaviour (namely
a user's goals, strategies, proficiency, and successes or failures) and in
doing so understand the usability of a given website.</p>

<h4> 2. Background </h4>


<p class="body">  This section describes
web server logs and how they are currently used in web analytics and concludes
with a description of an alterative way of using logfiles for understanding website
usability.</p>

<p class="subhead"> 2.1. Web
Server Logfiles</p>

<p class="body">  Web server logfiles are
a recording of user interactions on a website [6]. They are automatically
generated by the web server software hosting the website [8]. Whenever a user <i>clicks</i>
on a clickable item on the website (such as a link), a request is sent to the
web server, and new <i>entries</i> are recorded into the logfile [8]. A typical
entry in combined log format resembles the following:</p>


<table class=MsoTableGrid border=0 cellspacing=0 cellpadding=0 width="100%"
 style='width:100.0%;border-collapse:collapse;border:none'>
 <tr>
  <td width="100%" style='width:91.46%;padding:0cm 5.4pt 0cm 5.4pt'>
  <p class="body center>">90.07.06.86 â hciguy
  [15/Nov/2012:16:00:00 -0700] <br>
  "GET /index.html?search=routers HTTP.1.0" 200 2326 "http://www.google.com"Â 
  "Mozilla/5.0 (Macintosh; U; PPC Mac OS X; en) AppleWebKit/412.7 (KHTML, like
  Gecko) Safari/412.5"</p>
  </td>
 </tr>
</table><br>



<p class="body">  A <i>single</i> log
entry like the one above details a user's IP address (allowing them to be
uniquely identified, and identifies their geographic location); the date and
time of their interaction (Nov 15<sup>th</sup> at 4pm), describes their interaction
(<i>index.html?search=routers</i> is called a <i>request </i>and describes a
search performed on the homepage for <i>routers</i>); indicates the prior
website that referred them (www.google.com); and provides information on their
web browser and computer (Macintosh running Mozilla version 5.0). Although a <i>single</i>
log entry details only a user's <i>single click</i>, a series of log entries describes
a user's visit to the website. For example, the series of requests can be used
to follow the user's path through the website and identify interactions with
content. The time difference between timestamps provides the duration between
interactions.</p>

<p class="subhead"><i>2.1.1. Limitations
of Logfiles and Barriers to Logging</i> </p>

<p class="body">  Logfiles, however, are incapable
of capturing all interaction information, such as a user's thoughts, intentions,
gaze, voice, a visual of the user, time spent interacting with another website
or program, time spent away from the computer, or network latency. In addition,
logfiles are incapable of capturing cursor movements, clicks on non-clickable
items, cursor-selected text, page scrolling, interactions with the Internet
browser, and whether a link was opened in the same window or a new one. Logfiles
also do not capture interactions with dynamic content such as AJAX or Flash,
which do not send requests to the webserver and thus do not prompt logfile
entries to be generated. Also, if a website has frequently changing content or
structure, then the older log data will be invalid when cross-referenced with
the current website; although this can easily be remedied by keeping backups of
each website version [9].</p>

<p class="body">  In addition to these
limitations, technological barriers can undermine logging and the validity of
its data: proxy servers, client-side caching, and robots. Proxy servers mask
users' IP addresses, making distinct users indistinguishable [6]. This is
easily addressed by asking users to login [10]. Client side caching saves
previously visited webpages on the user's machine, then serves those saved pages
to the user when they revisit the website, causing no entry to be made in the
logfile [5]. This too is easily remedied by forcing web browsers to fetch a
fresh copy, called 'cache busting' [11]. Robots (bots), spiders, and web
crawlers are automated programs that visit websites to index them for search
engines, or for potentially malicious reasons, e.g., spambots and botnets.
These cause non-user-generated interactions to be recorded into the logfiles. Fortunately,
robot interactions can usually be identified and ignored [12]. </p>

<p class="body">  As a solution to some
of the limitations and barriers of logfiles, JavaScript tracking, the addition
of tracking code to every webpage, can be employed as an alternative method of tracking
user interactions [13]. JavaScript tracking can be used to record the same
information as logfiles, and in addition a host of other user interactions.
These include mouse events, keystrokes, text selection; page scrolling, resizing
the browser window, differentiating between users via <i>HTTP cookies,</i> and differentiating
between a page opened in the same window and one opened in a new window. However,
JavaScript tracking requires software code implementation, and data cannot be
harvested immediately; time must be given for interaction data to be recorded.
Also, users can disable JavaScript tracking if they delete their cookies,
disable JavaScript, or block tracking. In addition, JavaScript tracking code
slows down website performance because it transmits additional data, which can
have a very negative impact on a website, e.g., increased load time can result
in a loss of online sales.</p>

<p class="body">  The research described
in this paper focuses on automatically generated web server logfiles due to the
widespread availability of logfile data. The following describes other benefits
of using logfiles.</p>

<p class="subhead">2.2. Web
Analytics and Types of Analysis </p>

<p class="body">  Web analytics is "the
measurement, collection, analysis and reporting of Internet data for the
purpose of understanding and optimizing Web usage" [14] and makes use of logfile
or JavaScript tracking data. The result of web analytics is typically reported
through visualizations of website usage rather than raw numerical data. In
other words, visualization is the primary way that raw logfile data is
transformed into visual information. The likely reason for this is that
visualizations present data "in forms allowing humans to exploit their innate
visual analysis capabilities to interpret results" [15]. Techniques for
analysing and visualizing/reporting web analytics data come in four flavours: frequency
analysis, time analysis, exit analysis, and pattern analysis.</p>

<p class="body">  Frequency analysis looks
at the frequency of user interactions and can reveal information about users'
preferences and behaviour. For example, the frequency of a webpage's accesses (called
page views) can demonstrate its value to users [16]. Frequency is calculated by
simply tallying the number of times an interaction occurs. Tables and graphs
are typically used to represent this data (see Figure 1). Another visualization
technique for reporting frequency is called a heatmap where each clickable item
on a webpage is overlaid with a visual indicator of the frequency of
interaction, typically a colour block [9].</p>

<figcaption>
Figure 2.
Google Analytics reporting of Pathing.</figcaption>
</figure>


<p class="body">  Time analysis looks at
the amount of time spent on the website in a single visit and can indicate
proficiency, the degree to which a particular webpage forces user cognition [13],
or the interestingness (sic) of the content [16]. For example, if a user spends
a large amount of time on a page that requires them to complete an action, this
could mean that they are not proficient; the page requires a high degree of
cognition [13]; or that the page is poorly designed [17]. Alternatively, this
could indicate a large network latency, or that the user ceased interacting
with the website and started a new task elsewhere. The amount of time a user
spends on a content-abundant page can be used to determine its <i>interestingness</i>,
defined as the affinity a user has for a particular web page or feature [16]. </p>

<p class="body">  Regarding exit
analysis, Kaushik [7] states that where a user exits a website can indicate
their degree of success. For example, a user exiting on a content page relevant
to their search criteria suggests that they found what they were looking for,
whereas a user exiting on a help page suggests that the user did not find what
they were looking for [7]. <i>Bounce rate</i> is a type of exit analysis
depicting how often users visit and then leave a website without interacting
with anything [7]. A high bounce rate signifies that the website is
disappointing, and that value needs to be added in some way [7].</p>

<p class="body">  Pattern analysis aims
to discover patterns within analytics data. Some of these patterns provide
insights on past usage; others are predictive in nature [18]. <i>Association rules</i>,
for example, determine the probability that Content B will be accessed with
Content A (not time-ordered) and can be used to understand and predict usage
patterns [19]. <i>Pairing analysis</i> determines how often users perform certain
actions in a sequence (time-ordered), and can provide insight into UI elements
and tasks that can be combined to improve efficiency [20]. <i>Clustering</i>
involves discovering similar groups of users based on preferences or usage and
can be used to provide personalization, e.g., Amazon.com's recommendation
engine [21]. <i>Path analysis </i>or <i>clickstream</i> is a visualization
technique using nodes and directed edges to depict common paths through a
website (see Figure 2), and can be used to understand common navigation
patterns [22].</p>

<p class="body">  Although web analytics collects and uses individual usage
information, all of the above described techniques report quantitative
generalization of website usage. These techniques fail to describe individual
usage and behaviour vital to understanding website usability. This paper
proposes an alternative technique for understanding website usability through
logfiles: </p>

<ul>
<li>Extract user interactions captured in logfiles.</li>
<li>Use the interactions to re-enact a user's
progress through the Web UI, allowing a researcher to experience the user's visit
from the user's perspective.</li>
<li>Provide automated interpretation of the user's
interactions and provide controls to help understand the user's experience,
e.g. displaying the time spent per webpage, displaying a textual description of
interactions, and providing controls to traverse back and forth through the
interactions and visited pages.</li>
</ul>

<p class="body">  To facilitate the above, a software tool, UX-Log,
was developed to extract and recreate user experiences from logfiles with the
goal of making these recreations available to usability expert for
interpretation. This tool leveraged already existing logfiles, with the ability
to interpret them from a usability perspective through the recreation of the
user experiences. Unlike usability studies, this technique involves data from
actual users and the ability to observe the user experience without being there
and do so in an asynchronous manner, i.e., research done when needed and
sometime after the original user experience.</p>

<h4>3. Methodology </h4>
<p class="subhead"> 3.1. Design
of UX-Log </p>

<p class="body">  UX-Log has two
components: a back-end extractor and a front-end user interface for playing
back the interactions. The backend takes a series of logfiles and parses out
irrelevant information such as image, CSS, and JavaScript entries, as well as bot
activity. The logfiles are then placed in a relational SQL database for
efficient data storage and retrieval. Unique users are identified by their IP
address and user login. A distinct visit is identified whenever there is a 15-minute
or greater pause between interactions. </p>

<p class="body">  As seen in Figure 3, UX-Log's
frond-end displays the pages a user visited in the order they were visited (6,
3 &amp; 4); controls to navigate through the user-visited pages (2); the
relative amount of time spent on each page (4 &amp; 5); and the user's current interaction
(7).</p>

</figure>



<p class="subhead">3.2. Study
Design</p>

<p class="body">  In order to measure the success of UX-Log, the
definition of usability provided in Section 1 was split into 4 types of
insights: 1) understanding a user's goals; 2) understanding a user's strategies;
3) detecting a user's success or failure; and 4) understanding a user's
proficiency.</p>

<p class="body">  The protocol involved
logging a novice and expert user performing specific tasks using the Orlando
website (Orlando is an online tool for researching women's literature in the
British Isles). The authors were familiar with the website and user tasks and
as a result had a good understanding of the usability insights from the two
sessions. To evaluate UX-Log, ten usability experts were asked to use UX-Log to
gain usability insights from the UX-Log recreated sessions/experiences. Their
insights were recorded and then compared to the actual experiences of the
users.</p>

<p class="body">  In addition, the usability
experts were asked to evaluate the effectiveness and perceived value of UX-Log -
and by association, the user experience recreation from logfiles - for
understanding website usability. The accuracy of their insights, as well as
their rating of UX-Log, were used to evaluate the success of user experience
recreation from logfiles. Figure 4 summarizes the study methodology.</p>

<h4>4. Results and
Discussion </h4>


<p class="body">  Users' goals were inferred as
long as those goals were reflected in users' interactions with the website,
e.g., if a search term used matched a goal. All the usability experts were able
to infer that the novice user's goal was to research governesses since the term
'governess' was used in the search box, but none inferred that the novice was
researching in the 19<sup>th</sup> century, as the novice did not input a desired
date. Similarly, 8 of the 10 usability experts correctly inferred that the
expert user was looking for 'authors in the Theosophical Society' since this
was input into the search box. Only 3 inferred that the expert was searching
for bibliographic information, as there was no direct evidence of this in the
user's search terms. See Table 2 for details.</p>

<figure>
<figcaption>
Table 2. Participants' inferences of users' goals. </figcaption>


<img src="006%20-%20VWHCI_files/image005.png" class="article-img">
</figure>



<p class="body">  User strategy was successfully
inferred by looking at the types of user interface elements used, e.g., the search
and browsing capabilities. 9 of the 10 usability experts were able to infer
that the novice's strategy was 'trial-and-error' through their repeated use of
Search and the Back button. 7 usability experts were able to infer that the
expert's strategy was 'researching' through their exploration of related-content.
See Table 3 for details.</p>

<figure>
<figcaption>
Table 3. Participants' inferences of users' strategies.</figcaption>


<img src="006%20-%20VWHCI_files/image006.png" class="article-img">
</figure>



<p class="body">  Successes and failures were accurately
identified. However, ambiguous user behaviour such as sporadic browsing and
trial-and-error tactics made for low confidence in determining whether the user
was successful in reaching their goal. In addition, ambiguous interactions
required a good deal of mental effort by the usability experts to understand
what occurred. 8 of the 10 usability experts correctly inferred that the novice
was unsuccessful, and all of the usability experts correctly inferred that the
expert was successful. However, due to the ambiguous behaviour of the novice, usability
experts were not confident of the novice's failure. Also, when the expert
opened content in multiple browser tabs and windows, UX-Log could not convey
this to the usability experts in a definitive manner. The usability experts struggled
to comprehend this lack of clarity in the represented interactions, and as a
result, their interpretation of the expert user's tab-switching behaviour was
clouded and seen to be ambiguous. See Table 4 for details.</p>


<figure>
<figcaption>
Table 4. Participants' inferences of users' successes.</figcaption>


<img src="006%20-%20VWHCI_files/image007.png" class="article-img">
</figure>


<p class="body">  
Finally, relative proficiencies
between expert and novice users were determined, and accuracy of this
determination improved once both users' recreations were viewed. After viewing the
novice's user experience first, only 3 of the 10 usability experts accurately
classified the novice as such. However, once the participants viewed the expert
user (which always came second), 8 of them accurately classified the expert as
such, and 7 correctly re-classified the novice as such. In addition, users'
strategies and successes/failures helped indicate proficiencies. For example,
trial-and-error behaviour suggested novice usage and success suggested expert
usage. See Table 5 for details.</p>

<figure>
<figcaption>
Table 5. Participants' inferences of user proficiencies.</figcaption>


<img src="006%20-%20VWHCI_files/image008.png" class="article-img">
</figure>



<p class="body">  In rating UX-Log, 6 of the 10 usability
experts responded positively for 'immersion into a user experience'; 6
responded positively for 'enjoyableness'; 7 responded positively for 'interestingness';
and 9 responded positively for 'utility for usability studies'. In part, the
success of UX-Log can be attributed to its simple UI design, which proved to be
easy to learn and understand. However, design feedback gained suggests UX-Log's
user interface can be improved and as a result increase the effectiveness of
both the tool and the technique of user experience recreation from logfiles.
Specifically, additional textual description of user interactions and a better
way to navigate through each user experience are needed enhancements.</p>

<p class="subhead">4.1. Limitations </p>

<p class="body">  One expert and one novice
user experience were used to evaluate the effectiveness of UX-Log. Without
further work, it is unclear whether usability experts would have been able to determine
the relative proficiencies of less contrasting user experiences; and whether UX-Log
can be used to understand a more diverse range of users. Furthermore, the user
experiences were presented to the usability experts always starting with the
novice, making it unclear if the order of presentation had an affect on
results.</p>

<p class="body">  As previously stated, usability
experts received no training in UX-Log, the website, or the domain depicted in
the user experiences. This is atypical of usability experts who would be
familiar with all 3 areas before attempting to determine the usability of a
website. This lack of training was due to the limited availability of our
participants, but should be kept in mind when interpreting the results.</p>

<p class="body">  
Although UX-Log was successful
in understanding the usability of the Orlando website, this website did not
impose barriers to logging a rich set of actions and states. The technique
described in this paper may not be appropriate for websites with different
setups such as those with purely dynamic content. </p>

<p class="body">  If another logging technique
were to be used, such as JavaScript tracking, the raw data would be improved
and this technique and tool would have fewer limitations. </p>

<p class="subhead"> 4.2. Conclusions
and Future Work</p>

<p class="body"> Overall, user experience
recreation from logfiles and the UX-Log tool were successful for understanding
website usability; not only were usability experts able to understand what
users were doing, they were able to infer their goals, strategies, successes or
failures, and proficiencies. To put this into context, they were able to do
this without training in UX-Log, without familiarity of the website being
evaluated (a research tool for women's literature), and without domain
knowledge of the subject depicted in the user experiences (women's literature).</p>

<p class="body">  As this was a
preliminary study and the first of its kind to investigate user experience
recreation from logfiles, there are many opportunities for future work. Future
research should focus on improving validity through use of a larger sample of
users and proficiencies. In order to test user experience recreation in
real-world contexts, participants should receive thorough training on the tool,
domain, and website.Â  Future research should also take the next step from <i>understanding
</i>usability to <i>evaluating</i> usability by testing whether usability
experts can identify usability issues via user experience recreation from
logfiles.Â  There are also opportunities to enhance logfile capture and user
experience recreation through use of a hybrid logging technique (logfiles +
JavaScript tracking). There is also opportunity to evaluate user experience
recreation as a complement to usability testing, measuring the impact of this
added data source on derived insights. </p>

<p class="body">  Future iterations of
UX-Log should consider making UI enhancements to improve the usability and
effectiveness of the tool itself. Suggested enhancements include controls to
navigate non-linearly to any interaction in a user's experience; a full list of
user interactions; webpage-highlighting of elements clicked and pre-population
of user-inputted text; indicators of types of interactions; and indicators of repeated
and notable actions.</p>

<p class="body">  The value of using
UX-Log is that it is cost-effective, it requires few resources, it provides
access to a wealth of user experience information, and it facilitates
human-interpretation of machine-data. The outlined evolutions to the
methodology and tool would provide greater insight into the effectiveness of
user experience recreation from logfiles.</p>
