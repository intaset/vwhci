<h4>1. Introduction</h4>



<p class="body">Technology provides increasingly powerful tools for
communication and accessing information. Psychotherapy applications tailored to
meet the needs of those diagnosed with schizophrenia could provide
individualized, immediate, and cost-effective interventions, using convenient
devices that are steadily becoming more affordable. These mobile applications,
such as TherAPPist, represent a self-regulation tool that may be a valuable
adjunct to traditional treatment and asset to recovery.</p>

<p class="body">The investigational TherAPPist
app was developed by the authors to enhance the effectiveness of
traditional psychopharmacologic and psychotherapeutic interventions. Released
in April 2013, it currently provides the user with an easily accessible
relaxation routine, positive refocusing stimuli, images of supporters with
affirming messages, and emergency contacts. Its development continues, with
plans to allow customization of images and audio, as well as tracking of target
behaviors and affective outcomes. </p>

<p class="body">The immediate access to
therapeutic refresher messages afforded by the TherAPPist application was
intended to improve generalization of therapeutic learning. This app offers
immediate redirection and distraction, and provides individualized recovery
cues. Therapists can't be there all the time, but therAPPist can be! This
customizable app can put images and voices of supporters at the user's
fingertips, 24/7. </p>

<p class="body">Use of mobile applications
presents a valuable opportunity to improve outcomes for  individuals diagnosed
with schizophrenia spectrum disorders by supplying timely therapeutic
redirection, distraction, and coping tactics in highly challenging, provocative
situations.  A customizable mobile phone app can contribute to the development
of confidence by providing images, video, sound and text that are meaningful
for the individual user. The user's involvement in the customization process
can foster a sense of ownership that may reduce resistance to following
therapeutic suggestions.</p>

<p class="body">An effective mobile device
application can not only deter disruptive outbursts, but also improve treatment
overall. Progress can be conveniently monitored; troubleshooting can be
improved with more reliable data about triggering situations. In addition, immediate,
personalized reinforcement can be delivered to encourage progress. This may
help address some of the negative symptoms characterizing schizophrenia,
including apathy, amotivation, and anhedonia [1]. In addition, the app can
expand to reflect new learning, and serve as a visible product of recovery
success. The objective is not to eliminate the need for professional support,
but instead to provide real-time support so that consumers can function more
effectively, especially in stressful or emotionally charged situations. </p>

<p class="body">An app can also assist
individuals in the day to day management of their illness by providing tools to
track the correlation between mood and habits (such as taking medication), and
offering an opportunity to journal in stressful situations.  Furthermore, the
information tracked by the mobile device app can be reviewed as part of the
conventional therapy process, providing valuable data to both the consumer and
the mental health provider.Learning to use the app also builds users'
familiarity with current technology, helps to update their skills, and provides
a "normalizing" experience.</p>

<h4> 2. Development
of TherAPPist </h4>


<p class="body">This
innovative app was designed to provide support on a variety of levels,
everything from intervention in a high stress or emergency situation, to
capabilities for tracking their treatment progress through the use of daily
logs and goal tracking.  The most significant feature of the app is the ability
for it to be personalized and also its intended use as an integrated part of
traditional therapy.  When necessary, a therapist could help a client to tailor
the app by discussing common stressors, as well as helpful images, voice, or
text that may produce calming in a stressful situation.  For example, one
client may prefer to hear a voice clip of his therapist reminding him of the
appropriate reactions.  Another may prefer to see an image of her pet or a list
of her goals.  The app will be flexible so that multiple interventions can be
tried until a successful one is found.  Additionally, users can be encouraged
to use the app on a daily basis to track situations and their associated
emotions.  This information will then be readily available for discussion at
the next session.  </p>

<p class="body">Generally a
chronic, lifelong disorder that frequently impairs functioning from early
adulthood, schizophrenia continues to be quite challenging to treat.  Because
medication compliance figures prominently in relapse prevention, one
significant program feature will be the automation of reminders for medication
compliance, and also tracking features that will show the correlation between
positive habits (taking medicine, getting enough sleep), and outcomes (measured
by mood, stress, etc.).  Improvement in the area of conscientious management of
sometimes complex medication regimes should contribute to recovery success.</p>

<p class="subhead"> 2.1. Overview of the Primary Features
of TherAPPist</p>

<p class="body">The TherAPPist application is
designed to provide features that will be particularly helpful to individuals
with schizophrenia spectrum disorders. The application is intended to help
consumers:</p>

<ul>
<li>Maintain self-control and manage anxiety, anger, and depression, as well as enhance social skills, decision making skills, and confidence.</li>
<li>Reinforce the correlation between positive behaviors and outcomes, using simple, non-intrusive tracking mechanisms.</li>
<li>Be completely customizable so that the user can select the images and media files that are most useful to him/her.</li>
<li>Provide a valuable source of data which the consumer and his/her therapist can use to evaluate treatment effectiveness.</li>
</ul>

<p class="body">When a client first starts using
TherAPPist as part of his treatment program, the therapist works with him to
customize the app.  Whenever practical, default options will automatically be
selected to make the customization faster and smoother. After the initial
setup, the user will have the ability to change their selections through a
series of options menus.</p>

<p class="body">The Relaxation routine is an
audio relaxation induction.  Soothing Scenes provides a selection of positive
images to invite refocusing and return to a happier baseline.  Supportive
smiles presents a series of friendly images and phrases.  Emergency numbers is
a list of the most important contacts for easy access.  The Relaxation Routine
option is in the foremost spot, making it readily available in high-stress
situations.  </p>

Figure 2. The Planned
Tracker Feature.</figcaption>
</figure>



<p class="body">Figure 2 shows an early mockup of
the habit/mood tracking feature of the app.  The user will be prompted with
reminder messages (outside the app) at a preconfigured time each day, and will
be asked to use a simple 3-color scale to identify both the adherence to the
habit being tracked (sleep, eating right, taking medicine), and also the mood. 
The user can then review the month (or partial month) with the therapist, so
that visual patterns can be identified.  For example, in Figure 2, a
"red/black" day on the 2<sup>nd</sup> shows clearly that non-adherence to habit
can result in negative effects on mood, whiles days 3 and 4 show that better
(still not perfect) adherence to habit can greatly improve mood.   The customization features will allow multiple habits and outcomes to be easily be
tracked and shown on multiple calendars.  </p>

<p class="body">A medication tracker (to prompt
the user when medicine should be taken) and a journaling feature are also
planned.  Additional life-management and redirection features will be added as
time permits.  All of these features will provide valuable data to both the
individual and the therapist.  Participants in the clinical trials will provide
valuable feedback to determine the priority order for adding supplementary
features.  </p>

<p class="body">There are four operating systems that are commonly in use
for mobile devices: iOS (for iPhone and iPad), Android, Windows Phone 7, and
BlackBerry OS.  Of these systems, iOS and Android are the most commonly used,
with 53% and 28% of the market, respectively [26]; therefore, we initially
developed apps for these two operating systems.  Version 1.0 (shown in Figure
1) is already available for download for users of both Android and iOS
devices.  </p>

<p class="body">Preliminary informal surveys of
consumers affected by schizophrenic spectrum disorder issues leave us
encouraged that this app could be very useful. When groups of consumers have
been asked about whether such an app would be helpful, they have expressed near
universal enthusiasm. Many have stated that it would be "cool" to pull out a
phone in times of stress. Most maintain that rapid access to helpful
statements, images, and sounds would assist them in regulating emotion. They
liked the notion of being able to choose from options on a menu, in order to
tailor the helping process to their own tastes and preferences. Many liked the
idea of being able to install their favorite affirming self-statements. Several
cheered the chance to track their progress. They all seemed optimistic about
the potential of such a device to increase their happiness; most felt it might
help to defuse some tough situations.</p>

<p class="body">An informal query of clinicians
revealed that most agreed that this app has the potential to benefit many of
their consumers. Reassuringly, most of the therapists queried indicated that
they expected only a minority of their consumers to have difficulty mastering
use of a simplified app, and only a minority of consumers (12.5 %) was judged
to be potentially unsafe with such a device. It was also heartening to find
that a majority of the therapists expressed a willingness to try to incorporate
use of the app in their ongoing work with some consumers. All viewed it as a
useful adjunct to treatment, rather than as a competitor. Finally, some
mentioned that the app's providing of guidance in a more impersonal way might
reduce reactance and oppositional responding. Instead of feeling "nagged" by
family, friends, and therapists, the app could provide an empowering means for
consumers to receive timely recovery and wellness information.</p>

<p class="body">The current study assessed the
feasibility of using this mobile device with consumers diagnosed with
schizophrenic spectrum disorders by surveying experienced clinicians.
Respondents indicated the prevalence among their consumers of various problems
addressed byTherAPPist. They also estimated the percentage of their consumers,
both in inpatient residential care and in community residences, who could
safety make use of a mobile phone.</p>

<h4> 3. Related Work </h4>

<p class="body">Although many forms of treatment
are helpful, and medication generally reduces symptoms, relapse is an ongoing
problem for many consumers with schizophrenia. Medication non-adherence figures
prominently in this, as do other difficulties related to structuring time and
activities on one's own. Problems with maintaining social contact and support
also contribute to relapse. Research has shown that developing a relapse
prevention plan and teaching strategies for coping with persistent symptoms
measurably improve outcomes [2].  Medication adherence and persistence in
schizophrenia is alarmingly low. According to Lieberman, Stroup, and McEvoy [3]
between 64 – 82% discontinued initial medication within 18 months.
Unfortunately, even brief medication lapses can have serious and costly
consequences.  For example, Weiden [4] found a twofold increased risk of
hospitalization following non-adherance as brief as 10 days.</p>

<p class="body">Since remembering to deploy
various lessons learned in therapy remains a challenge for many consumers with
schizophrenia and schizoaffective disorder, the application's main value may
lie in its capacity to prompt, remind, and enhance generalization. However, in
addition to automating medication reminders and enabling therapists to detect
non-adherence early on, and providing immediate relaxation and refocusing
aides, TherAPPist also bridges the discharge support gapby augmenting the social
support systemin a cost-effective way. Often individuals who do beautifully in
settings where others are always available to prompt responses and offer
reminders, or to offer redirection and distraction, deteriorate after moving to
less structured settings with less ongoing contact with support staff. </p>

<p class="body">Treatment of schizophrenia
remains a challenge, despite dramatic improvements in psychopharmacotherapy and
verbal psychotherapy. Increasingly, psychotherapy researchers have sought to
identify best clinical practices through empirical investigations, in order to
delineate evidence-based treatments for persons with these illnesses [5]. The
randomized, controlled trial paradigm has yielded confidence in approaches such
as The Illness Management and Recovery Program [6], Social Skills Training [7],
and Relapse Prevention Training [8]. A meta-analytic evaluation of 27 social
skills training (SST) studies involving schizophrenic persons revealed that SST
dramatically improved patients' behavior in social situations, assertiveness
and self-confidence, and hospital-discharge rate.  Social Skills Training also
helped to lower relapse rates [7].  This study was less definitive about the
successful generalization of skills developed via social skills training. </p>

<p class="body">In the
treatment of schizophrenia, generalization of therapeutic learning is often
limited. For example, many addressing self-control problems respond well during
treatment sessions, but fail to deploy their new coping strategies in their
daily lives. Shohamy, Mihalakos, Chin, Thomas, Wagner, and Tamminga [9] found
individuals with schizophrenia to be selectively impaired in their ability to
generalize knowledge, despite having intact learning and memory accuracy.
Efforts to enhance generalization, including role play, are somewhat
successful, but often work only in less emotionally charged situations [10].
When situational provocation is strong, and anger or fear levels are high, all
too often the client resorts to their earlier (often self-destructive or
self-defeating) mode of responding. Learning how to slow down and reflect
before acting is extremely difficult for some clients. Use of simple, memorable
strategies (e.g., Stop-Think-Relax; [11]) can help clients to give themselves
time to process information carefully before running the risk of overreacting. However,
again and again, many clients unfortunately forget to use even these easy
tactics.  </p>

<p class="body">Enhancing generalization by
augmenting conventional social skills training with specially designed mobile
applications that offer immediate "refresher" experiences mayenhance treatment.
Consistent with this,<b> </b>Kopelowicz, Liberman, and Zarate [12] argued that
while beneficial, social skills training was not meant to function alone. They
endorsed the possible incorporation of outside tactics into the actual methods
used for social skills training, because they saw this as necessary for
successful treatment.</p>

<p class="body">A variety of other
psychoeducational interventions have been shown to increase consumers' basic
knowledge about their psychiatric illness, and relapse prevention programs also
have been found to be helpful [8, 13]. Although several psychosocial
interventions are associated with improved functioning among those with
schizophrenia, unfortunately these evidence-based practices have not been
routinely available to many consumers who might profit from them [14]. Using
mobile technology to make these useful practices more widely available could
also benefit many consumers.</p>

<p class="body">Many patients with schizophrenia
experience a relapse after hospital discharge [15], often due to problems
handling the lack of structure and support [16].  The TherAPPist app was
designed to provide a mechanism for bridging this support gap for those in
recovery, and can provide valuable data about the individual's use of various
tactics that they have learned in therapy.This data can then be used by the
individual and his/her therapist to alter treatment strategies appropriately.</p>

<p class="body">Although The Illness Management
and Recovery Program has been found to yield significant improvement in overall
outcome, knowledge about illness, and progress in achieving personal goals, it
has proven less successful for producing reliable gains on measures of social
support, despite its aim to help clients improve their symptom management and social
[6, 17]. Hasson-Ohayon, Roe, and Kravetz [6] suggest that because applying
coping techniquesin challenging situations and establishing and maintaining
relationships and are more complex and demanding than internalizing information
about illness and identifying personal goals, additional methods of assistance
may be needed to achieve these important recovery objectives. The TherAPPist
app may enable greater progress in these areas.</p>

<p class="body">This app may be especially
helpful for those who withdraw and isolate during times of stress. Unfortunately,
this is quite common, because mistrust among these consumers is pervasive and
often complicates the treatment process. Frequently, a history of interpersonal
struggles marked by criticism, rejection, confusion, miscommunication, and
mutual fear has left consumers suspicious of others. Some have particular
difficulty reaching out to others when they most need support and redirection,
at times of high negative emotional intensity. Many prefer at those challenging
times to withdraw socially, but unfortunately lack reliably effective
self-soothing strategies. Individuals with schizophrenia often cope with stress
in a relatively ineffectual manner, often leading to poor outcomes [18]. Some
maintain that the dangerously high smoking rates in this population (90%) are
due to attempts of individuals to self-medicate; nicotine's up-regulation of
GABA reduces the overstimulation, and many schizophrenics are unable to manage
with other self-calming strategies.  TherAPPistis intended to simplify the
coping process by permitting consumers to provide themselves with calming cues
and refocusing prompts. Hopefully, these rapid reminders will help them to
manage negative feelings more constructively and reorient their attention
positively. </p>

<p class="body">At times of heightened stress, many
consumers cannot generate constructive behavioral or cognitive options on their
own. Because a support person is not always available at these moments to
redirect attention and cue optimal responses, problem behaviors arise and
crises escalate unnecessarily. Once skilled in activating this app, the
consumer will be able to more self-sufficiently manage challenges. This should
enhance perceived self–efficacy, further contributing to resilience and
recovery. Believing that you can handle tough moments independently can be very
empowering.</p>

<p class="body">Recently much
attention has focused on development of early interventions that may reduce
damage resulting from repeated episodes of psychoses. An example of this
approach, Recovery After an Initial Schizophrenia Episode (RAISE) is aimed at
applying a multimodal aggressive response to the first episode of psychosis.
This project seeks to improve the prognosis of schizophrenia through systematic
interventions during the earliest stages of schizophrenic illness. RAISE is designed
to reduce the long-term disability commonly associated with this illness by
fostering achievement of recovery goals of independence and productivity. This
should reduce the costs associated with long-term care. Mobile applications
could assist programs such as RAISE in reducing the risk of long-term
disability by fostering early medication adherence and other wellness
objectives, including those related to sleep hygiene, nutrition, exercise, and
maintenance of social support. </p>

<h4> 4. Other Health Mobile Applications</h4>

<p class="body">Use of technology, particularly
mobile technology, to assist with managing illness and maintaining healthy
habits is increasingly popular.  There are a variety of apps that are designed
to help motivate and track healthy habits for those who are trying to lose
weight, for example.  Two such apps, Livestrong'sMyPlate and Arawella
Corporations' Calorie Counter, provide functions for tracking food, nutrition
and calories, as well as activity, on a daily basis.  They also provide long
term progress charts and graphs. Millions of mobile device users have
downloaded and use these apps regularly.  </p>

<p class="body">Moreover,
there is growing evidence that these apps are effective.  An evaluation of
Aurora, a mobile phone based app for emotion recording and sharing, showed that
the app encourages people to be more aware of their emotions and leads them to
engage in socially supportive behavior [19].  A similar study by Deleeuw et. al
[20] comes to the same conclusion.  Additional evidence suggests that apps
which run on mobile phones can be effective tools for the management of chronic
diseases such as diabetes, hypertension, and asthma [21, 22, 23].  The National
Library of Medicine (NLM) maintains a "Gallery of Mobile Apps and Sites" which
features apps for tracking medications (MyMedList), accessing consumer
information about drugs (DailyMed) as well as general research (access to
PubMed for Handhelds), and specific health related information, such as LactMed
for nursing mothers, and AIDSinfo mobile for AIDS patients and their doctors (http://www.nlm.nih.gov/mobile/). 
PmEB, a mobile device app for monitoring caloric balance in obese children and
adults, was used to develop a heightened sense of self-awareness and promote
self-monitoring [24].</p>

<p class="body">According to
a recent PEW survey, 83% of American Adults own some kind of cell phone, and
35% own a smart phone of some kind.  In the previous 30 days, 51% of adult cell
phone owners had used their phones at least once to get information that they
needed right away, 40% had used the phone in an emergency situation, and 42%
had used the phone to stave off boredom [25].  </p>

<h4>5. Method </h4>

<p class="body">Forty-two psychologists, social
workers, and therapeutic support aides(18 [43%] male, 24 [57%] female)who
regularly provide services to consumers diagnosed with schizophrenia,as well as
othersevere mental illnesses,served as participants in the current
investigation (mean age: 45.67 years; mean years of clinical experience: 18.30
years). Surveys were administered to professional continuing education program
attendees, prior to a discussion about the potential advantages and
disadvantages of using mobile application technology as an adjunct to
treatment. The survey assessed the clinician's years of experience working with
MH/ID consumers, as well as the therapist's age and sex. Respondents were asked
how many of their current consumers benefit from 15 functions scheduled to be
offered by the investigational mobile application, including the following: Help
using skills learned in therapy outside of treatment; redirection when upset ;
relaxation induction when upset; reminders about their strengths; reminders
about supportive others; positive activities when bored; listening to music
when upset; refocusing when upset; reminders to take medication; journaling;
monitoring their goal behaviors; monitoring how they feel; auditory feedback
about progress; visual feedback about progress; and reminders to eat well. They
were also asked how many of their current consumers could safely use a cell phone,
as well as how many of their former consumers now in the community could safely
use a cell phone.</p>

<h4> 6. Results </h4>

<p class="body">The clinicians surveyed reported
that the majority (56.24%) of their current consumers could safely use a cell
phone. An even greater proportion (70.24%) of community-based consumers were
viewed as capable of safely using a cell phone. The following table indicates
the percentage of consumers that clinicians believed could benefit from the
functions offered by TherAPPist.</p>

<p class="body">When the most highly rated types
of assistance (strengths reminders, redirection, positive activities, music)
were compared, paired samples t-tests showed no significant differences in
their perceived value to consumers.When the next tier of types of assistance (refocusing,
medication reminders, visual progress feedback, generalization help, auditory
progress feedback, supportive others, monitoring feelings, and relaxation
induction) were compared, paired samples t-tests indicated that relaxation
induction was seen as less beneficial to consumers than many other
interventions in the second tier: refocusing (t=3.14, df=41, p&lt;.01),
medication reminders (t=3.46, df=41, p&lt;.001), and generalization help (t=2.38,
df=41, p&lt;.05).  The other helping components in this tier were rated as
comparably important. Relaxation induction was also seen as likely to benefit
fewer consumers than all of the four first tier interventions,</p>

<p class="body">Among the three
lowest rated interventions, journaling was perceived to benefit the fewest of
these consumers. Paired samples tests showed that journaling was rated
significantly lower than monitoring feelings (t=5.75, df=41, p&lt;.001), monitoring
behavior (t=4.30, df=41, p&lt;.001), and eating reminders (t=2.87, df=41,
p&lt;.01).</p>


<h4> 7. Discussion </h4>

<p class="body">Clinicians reported that over
two-thirds of their consumers in the community could safely make use of cell
phone technology; a lower percentage, but still a majority, of those currently in
inpatient settings were seen as candidates for this technology. A majority of
consumers were seen as likely to benefit from the reminders about their
strengths, redirection, positive activities, and access to music that the appwill
provide. The assistance with refocusing, medication adherence, auditory and visual
progress feedback, and generalization offered by therAPPist were also expected
to benefit over two-thirds of these clients. Somewhat fewer consumers were seen
as likely to benefit from the journaling, relaxation, and behavioral tracking
features of the app. Since using these latter features may be seen as requiring
greater cognitive skills, it may be especially important to simplify and
abbreviate these features of the app to make them suitable for this group of
consumers. </p>

<p class="body">These findings suggest that
additional research using this technology with such consumers would be
valuable.This inexpensive app (99cents) offers individualized (via customizable
components), timely (via immediacy of help), and responsive (via provision of
feedback on progress) assistance. If effective in promoting greater self-control,
this app has the potential to enhance consumers' lives and reduce healthcare
costs. When fleeting emotional reactions are handled inappropriately, unsafe
behaviors can necessitate expensive hospitalization or arrest. A typical
inpatient facility stay costs $1227 per day and lasts 6.6 days. </p>

<p class="body">The psychological price of an
involuntary commitment on a locked unit can be even more challenging to endure.
Similarly, being arrested and secluded in jail imposes both financial and
psychic costs. According to a June 2010 article published in The Economist,
yearly spending on a single inmate ranges from $18,000 in Mississippi to approximately
$50,000 in California, where the average bill per day to house an inmate in
state prisons is about $129.  If this app can even modestly reduce episodes of
incarceration among those diagnosed with schizophrenia, it will represent an
important step forward.</p>


<h4> 8. Future Work </h4>

<p class="body">Often, a small intervention can
make a big difference in preventing a maladaptive escalation, if it can be
offered at just the right time. It is hoped that TherAPPist will enable
consumers to have more control over delivery of services, making treatment more
responsive to their immediate needs. TherAPPist reduces the need to wait for
assistance, which may make all the difference for many easily frustrated, impulsive
consumers.  </p>

<p class="body">Since executive function
impairment underlies so many forms of personally and socially maladaptive
behavior, mobile applications designed to supplement self control capabilities
have the promise to enhance lives. As technology advances, and devices
incorporate more biometric data, future therapeutic mobile applications will
serve as tools to improve behavioral functioning, health, and subjective
well-being. </p>

<p class="body">The need to curb growth of
healthcare spending mandates the development of  more creative means of
assisting those with various chronic illnesses. The timely, inexpensive,
continuous support made possible by mobile applications such as TherAPPist could
dramatically improve the lives of those with schizophrenia and other brain
disorders, without unduly straining budgets. </p>


<h4>Disclosure </h4>

<p class="body">The authors jointly developed and
are disseminating one type of mobile application for enhancing the treatment of
schizophrenia (TherAPPist). Although the survey used in this study assessed the
general feasibility of mobile applications in helping these consumers and the
potential utility of functions potentially offered via various generic mobile
applications, a competing interest exists here due to the potential financial
gain associated with the marketing of TherAPPist.</p>
