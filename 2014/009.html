This paper analyzes the requirements of users of different generations with regard to future e-banking systems. An empirical study was conducted to verify six previously formulated hypotheses. The results show that the acceptance of such systems highly depends on factors such as age, gender and general technical affinity. It turned out that most of the older people are not yet willing to use such systems at all – independent of specific system characteristics. Additionally, it is more likely that men will use smart banking systems than women and that technical affinity has a positive influence on the general usage intention.	</i></p>

<h2>1. Introduction</h2>

<p align="justify" style="text-indent:19.85pt;">
With the wide-spread diffusion
of the Internet in the beginning of the 21st century, banks world-wide were
forced to face new challenges with regard to electronic distribution channels.
In this context, it is of particular importance to analyze the requirements of
potential customers in an early phase of the design process of new systems [1].
Previous systems focused mainly on supporting financial transactions and were
only recently extended to multi-functional online platforms that provide most
functions, which have long been reserved to bank costumers [2].</p>

<p align="justify" style="text-indent:19.85pt;">
Figure 1 illustrates the projected
numbers of total Internet users and the projected numbers of people who
actively used Internet banking in Germany during the period 2006 - 2012. It
becomes obvious that there is a high correlation between the corresponding numbers
of users. Compared to the usage of the Internet, Internet banking is still only
used by a relatively small part of the population. While recent data from Germany
[3] shows that 73.3% of the German population over 14 years are using the
Internet, only about half of this group is also using Internet banking  (2006:
41%, 2012: 50%). Due to the observable trend within the last three years (see
Figure 1) and the high market saturation, one cannot expect that the number of
Internet users continues to rise. According to the trend, the same seems to
hold for the number of people who use Internet banking even though there are
still lots of potential future users who already use the Internet but refrain
from using Internet banking.</span></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<br>


<p align="justify" style="text-indent:19.85pt;">
This paper aims at finding reasons for this gap in order to
explain why only a comparably small proportion of the Internet users also uses
Internet banking. To do so, the requirements of potential end users will be
analyzed. While the perception and acceptance of existing online banking
applications have been addressed in various studies in the past, there is
currently very little knowledge with regard to the attitude of users towards
smart banking applications, which are likely to emerge in the coming years.</p>




<h2> 2. Related Work  </h2>

<p align="justify" style="text-indent:19.85pt;">
Existing work relevant in the
context of this paper can be clustered into three main areas:</p>

<ul style="list-style-type: square;">
	<li style="margin-left: 90px;">Description and analysis of historic or existing applications [5-6],</li>
	<li style="margin-left: 90px;">Empirical evaluations of user acceptance [2], [7-10],</span></li>
	<li style="margin-left: 90px;">Studies addressing future and emerging technologies and services [11-16].</li>
</ul></p>


<p align="justify" style="text-indent:19.85pt;">
The papers classified into the
first cluster examine the research field from the perspective of banks and show
that competition is the driving factor for the introduction of banking
applications in general. They attribute an important role to the Internet that
allows banks to attract new customers in the long view. Liao and Cheung [5]
already recognized in 2003 that security and privacy concerns are driving
factors that affect the acceptance of Internet banking. This was confirmed by Wang
et al. in the same year [10] and Caroline Möckel in 2011 [2].
</span></p>


<p align="justify" style="text-indent:19.85pt;"> 
Beside Aladwani [7] and French
et al. [8], they belong to the group of researchers who performed an empirical
evaluation of acceptance factors influencing the use of banking applications.
In her study, Aladwani collaborated with eight banks and potential customers
while French et al. analyzed with the aid of the card sorting method how
acceptance is influenced by different types of website designs. Both results
are consistent and worked out trust as the crucial acceptance factor. One of
the largest empirical evaluations (n=1167) was carried out in Finland [9] in
order to explore the effect of different factors affecting attitude formation
towards Internet banking. It turned out that prior experience of computers and
technology, as well as attitude towards computers influence the attitude
towards Internet banking and thereby the actual usage behavior.</p>


<p align="justify" style="text-indent:19.85pt;">
The majority of recent publications belongs to the third identified research cluster. The elaborations
[11], [12], and [13] investigate the question how the future of banking may
look like. They come to the conclusion that the branch bank network will scale
down. Nevertheless, the results show that we are far away from a live without
personal consultation as offered by bank consultants. Beck [11] sees the
reasons for this in the asymmetric information distribution in the banking
sector which implies that end users are dependent on the knowledge of bank
consultants. Not without irony, Kühn indicates that this problem might be
solved in the near future: "Thanks to the Internet, today's end users have
access to exactly the same information as their bank consultants" [12]. Two
techniques that make use of data mining in order to assist users in making
"good" decisions during their banking activities were proposed by Aggelis et
al. [14] and Ionita et al. [15]. Nami [16] took another approach and described
how customers, banks and the whole economy can profit from electronic banking
and summarizes problems that the designers of future banking system need to be
aware of. Increased efficiency and cost reduction are the most advantageous
aspects. On the other side, faulty systems or systems that lack of usability
undoubtedly lead to a loss of trust and reputation of the bank. Therefore, it
was observed that banks often hesitate to introduce complex, innovative banking
systems.</p>



<h2>3. Research Goal and Approach </h2>

<p align="justify" style="text-indent:19.85pt;">
In contrast to the three streams
of research introduced in the related work section, this paper follows a more
user-centered approach and aims at identifying the requirements of users with
regard to the design of future e-banking systems as well as the usage barriers
that might exist. The study explicitly aims at involving users well as
non-users of existing e-banking systems in order to identify potential
differences between these groups.</p>

<p align="justify" style="text-indent:19.85pt;">  
In existing literature (see,
e.g., [9], [10], [17], [18], [19] or [20]) a variety of factors have been
identified, which showed to have a significant influence on the acceptance and
usage of new technologies. As we expect that most of this factors can be
transferred to the acceptance of smart banking applications, our focus is
especially on the following three factors.</p>


<h4>3.1. Affinity towards Technology</h4>

<p align="justify" style="text-indent:19.85pt;">
Several studies (see, e.g., [22])
show that computer literacy and the user's general attitude towards technology
are two important factors that significantly influence the intention to use new
technologies. Existing research supports the assumption that the results of
these studies can be generalized for most modern technologies. In case of smart
banking applications, this would foster the hypothesis that users who successfully
use existing technical devices are more likely to accept new electronic banking
applications.</p>

<h4> 3.2. Age </h4>

<p align="justify" style="text-indent:19.85pt;">
Ziefle and Wilkowska [21]
explored the acceptance of several systems offering medical assistance in home
environments and found that different age groups have different reason for
accepting and rejecting different types of technologies. Similar age-related
acceptance patterns were also found for non-medical technologies (see, e.g., [23]
or [24]). We expect to find comparable results and anticipate that the
acceptance of smart banking applications is significantly affected by age.</p>

<h4>3.3. Gender </h4>

<p align="justify" style="text-indent:19.85pt;"> 
Gender-specific differences are
found in most technology acceptance studies [25][25] and should therefore be taken into account when exploring the usage intention of smart banking
applications. For example, Venkatesh and Morris [27] studied the introduction
of software systems in companies and found that the adoption decisions of men
mostly depend on the usefulness of a system, while the decisions of women are
strongly affected by the perceived usability. Similar behavioral patterns are likely
to exist for smart banking applications.</p>




<h2>4. Methodology </h2>

<h4>4.1. Hypotheses </h4>

<p align="justify" style="text-indent:19.85pt;"> 
The combination of existing
knowledge about fundamental acceptance factors and our overall research goal
led to the formulation of the following hypotheses:</p>

<h4><i>4.1.1. Hypothesis H1</i></h4>

<p align="justify" style="text-indent:19.85pt;">
Younger people tend to show a
higher general interest in technology in comparison to older generations. In
addition, gender differences can be observed.</p>

<h4><i>4.1.2. Hypothesis H2</i> </h4>

<p align="justify" style="text-indent:19.85pt;">
Usage experience and usage
intensity of existing technical systems tend to decrease with increasing age.
In addition, gender differences can be observed.</p>

<h4> <i>4.1.3. Hypothesis H3</i> </h4>

<p align="justify" style="text-indent:19.85pt;">
Younger people have less
problems and more fun using existing technical systems and see a greater
usefulness in these systems than older generations. In addition, gender
differences can be observed.</p>

<h4> <i>4.1.4. Hypothesis H4 and H5</i></h4>

<p align="justify" style="text-indent:19.85pt;">
The willingness to use e-banking
services decreases with increasing age and depends on the gender. The general
affinity towards cashless payments follows the same trend.</p>

<h4><i>4.1.5. Hypothesis H6</i> </h4>

<p align="justify" style="text-indent:19.85pt;"> 
The willingness to use emerging
smart banking systems decreases with increasing age. It is more likely that men
will use such systems than women.</p>

<h4>4.2. Participants </h4>

<p align="justify" style="text-indent:19.85pt;">
The majority of participants was
recruited through the social networks of the authors. In total, N = 61 (53%
women) between the age of 16 and 84 years participated in the study. The return
rate of the questionnaires was around 86%. For further analysis, the
participants were split into three age groups respectively generations [21][26]:</p>

<ul style="list-style-type: square;">
	<li style="margin-left: 90px;">Computer Generation (CG) - between 15 and 35 years,</li>
	<li style="margin-left: 90px;">Household Revolution Generation (HRG) - between 36 and 55 years,</span></li>
	<li style="margin-left: 90px;">Early Technical Generation (ETG) - older than 55 years.</li>
</ul></p>

<p align="justify" style="text-indent:19.85pt;">The distribution of the age structure within each generation
is shown in Figure 2.</p>

<br>
<figure>
<img src="AEC001_files/image002.jpg" class="img"/>

<figcaption>
Figure 2.  Boxplot: age-distribution within the three generations.</figcaption>
</figure>
<br>

<p align="justify" style="text-indent:19.85pt;"> The group of participants of the CG consists of N = 20
people aged between 16 and 35 years (M = 23, SD = 5.6), of which 35% are
female. The HRG (N = 30) consists of persons aged between 36 and 55 years (M =
46, SD = 4.5). Around 60% of the participants of this group are female. The
final group (ETG) comprises N = 11 participants aged 56 years or above (64%
female). Compared to the other two groups, the standard deviation is
considerable bigger (M = 72, SD = 9.0) as the age range spans a larger interval
(see Figure 4).</p>

<h4>4.3. Questionnaire </h4>

<p align="justify" style="text-indent:19.85pt;">
In order to reach participants
in all three age groups, paper-based questionnaires were used. Even if
web-based data acquisition tools would have probably led to a higher number of
participants, we explicitly chose a pen-and-paper approach to also include
older and less computer-literate persons. The questionnaire consisted of 77
items and was divided into three main areas: personal data, general interest in
technology, and electronic banking activities (see Table 1). Filling out the
final version of the questionnaire took about 15 to 20 minutes. </p>

</figure>
<br>

<h4>4.4. Research Variables </h4>

<p align="justify" style="text-indent:19.85pt;">
Two different types of variables
were considered in the analysis. Variables that were directly captured in the
questionnaire (e.g., age or gender) and index variables that were calculated by
combing several individual variables (e.g., general interest in technology). In
addition, the participants were further sub-divided into groups of similar
interests or behaviors (e.g., with regard to their willingness to use e-banking
systems).</p>





<h2>5. Results </h2>
<p align="justify" style="text-indent:19.85pt;">
The results were analyzed using
variance analysis (ANOVA) and t-tests. The significance level was set to 5%. The
evaluation was guided by the six hypotheses illustrated above. Before results are
explained in detail, Table 2 illustrates the sections from the questionnaire from
which the particular dependent and independent variables were chosen. This will
help to identify direct (e.g., age) and indirect factors (e.g., interest in
technology) influencing acceptance.</p>

<br>

<h4>5.1. Hypothesis H1 </h4>

<p align="justify" style="text-indent:19.85pt;">
Younger people (CG) tend to show
a higher general interest in technology in comparison to older generations (HRG,
ETG). In addition, gender differences can be observed.</p>

<p align="justify" style="text-indent:19.85pt;">
A first analysis was conducted
to explore whether age and gender influence the general interest in technology
(Figure 3). Considering the index value representing general interest in
technology, a significant main effect of age (F(2, 54) = 5.50, p &lt; .007) and
gender (F(1, 54) = 12.26, p &lt; .001) could be observed. For both factors,
there is no interaction effect. Independent of the age group, women are less
interested in technology than men and the interest in technology decreases with
increasing age (true for both genders). Similar results were found in previous
studies [21].</p>

<figure>
<img src="AEC001_files/image005.jpg" class="img"/>

<figcaption>
Figure 3. General
interest in technology (age, gender).</figcaption>
</figure>
<br>

<h4>5.2. Hypothesis H2 </h4>

<p align="justify" style="text-indent:19.85pt;"> 
Usage experience and usage
intensity of existing technical systems tend to decrease with increasing age.
In addition, gender differences can be observed.</p>

<p align="justify" style="text-indent:19.85pt;">
 In the next step we analyzed how far usage intensity and
technical experience depend on age and gender (Figure 4). For the usage
intensity, significant main effects for age (F(2, 55) = 24.53, p &lt; .001) and
gender (F(1, 55) = 7.42, p &lt; .009) could be observed. The same applies for the
usage experience. In both cases, there are no interaction effects for any of
the two factors.</p>

<p align="justify" style="text-indent:19.85pt;">
Post-hoc analyses for technical
experience (by using Tukey's HSD test) revealed that the general technical
experience within the ETG is lower than within the HRG (p &lt; .001) and the CG
(p &lt; .001). However, the difference between the two younger generations is
not significant (p &lt; .191).</p>

<p align="justify" style="text-indent:19.85pt;">
However, a comparative review of
the results for general interest in technology, usage intensity and usage
experience showed a different trend as the experience index for women within
the youngest generation is slightly higher than for men.</p>

<h4>5.3. Hypothesis H3 </h4>

<p align="justify" style="text-indent:19.85pt;"> 
Younger people (CG) have less
problems and more fun using existing technical systems and see a greater
usefulness in these systems than older generations (HRG, ETG). In addition,
gender differences can be observed.</p>

<p align="justify" style="text-indent:19.85pt;">
In order to explore whether a
general affinity for technology depends on socio-demographic factors, two
additional index values were analyzed: those that represent learnability and
usability respectively fun and utility (Figure 5).</p>

<figure>

<br>

<p align="justify" style="text-indent:19.85pt;">
 Regarding the index value for learnability and usability, a
significant main effect for age (F(2, 51) = 10.57, p &lt; .001) could be
observed, while gender did not affect this value significantly. Likewise, the index
value for fun and utility showed only a significant main effect for age (F(2,
51) = 9.75, p &lt; .001). A Post-hoc analysis by using Tukey's HSD test showed
that the deviations between the ETG and HRG (p &lt; .513) and the ETG and CG (p
&lt; .137) are not significant, while the difference between the CG and HRG is
highly significant (p &lt; .001). Similar to previous results, no interaction
effects were found.</p>

<h4>5.4. Hypothesis H4 and H5 </h4>

<p align="justify" style="text-indent:19.85pt;">
The willingness to use e-banking
services decreases with increasing age and depends on the gender. The general
affinity towards cashless payments follows the same trend.</p>

<p align="justify" style="text-indent:19.85pt;">
Neither the average willingness to use of different e-banking
services [age: (F(2, 46) = 1.31, p &lt; .279), gender: (F(1, 46) = 0.134, p &lt;
.716)], nor the willingness to use for cashless payments [age: (F(2, 53) =
0.472, p &lt; .626), gender: (F(1, 53) = 0.684, p &lt; .412)], showed a
significant main effect for age or gender.</p>

<br>

<p align="justify" style="text-indent:19.85pt;">
The affinity towards cashless payments (Figure 6) is very
high for all age groups likewise. In contrast, the willingness to use e-banking
systems is comparably lower. Table 3 provides an overview of the willingness to
use different e-banking services (0% = I do not like to use this service at
all, 100% = I am very keen on using this service).</p>

<figure>

</figure>
<br>

<p align="justify" style="text-indent:19.85pt;">
In general, e-banking services could be classified according
to two criteria: standardization and degree of risk. In this context, services
with a low risk and high standardization tend show the highest usage
intentions, while the intention to use services tends to decreases with a
decreasing degree of standardization and an increasing degree of risk. The
findings summarized in Table 3 foster this assumption. Hence, the observed
intention to use highly standardized services with low risk is considerably
higher than 50%, while less standardized services with a moderate degree of
risk only show usage intentions below 50%. Comparably high values with regard
to the standard deviation can be found (among others) for stock trading and the
investment in fixed deposit. This shows that the preferences of users in these
areas are not very homogenous.</p>

<h4>5.5. Hypothesis H6 </h4>

<p align="justify" style="text-indent:19.85pt;">
The willingness to use emerging
smart banking systems decreases with increasing age. It is more likely that men
will use such systems than women.</p>

<p align="justify" style="text-indent:19.85pt;">
Previously, we analyzed the
extent to which the usage of current e-banking systems is influenced by the
factors age and gender. This section aims at analyzing how these factors
influence the usage intention of emerging smart banking applications (Figure 7).</p>

<figure>
<img src="AEC001_files/image010.jpg" class="img"/>

<figcaption>
Figure 7.  Willingness to use smart banking systems.</figcaption>

<br>

<p align="justify" style="text-indent:19.85pt;">
\Significant main effects could be observed for age (F(2, 55)
= 6.83, p &lt; .002) and gender (F(1, 55) = 5.75, p &lt; .020), while no
interaction effect is present. Hence, these results validate our previous
hypothesis. Similar to the general interest in technology, technical experience
and the usage of technology, the women belonging to the oldest generation (ETG)
show the least willingness to use emerging banking technologies.</p>



<h2>6. Discussion </h2>
<p align="justify" style="text-indent:19.85pt;">
First of all, it is important to
note that it turned out to be very difficult to collect opinions from people belonging
to the oldest generation (ETG) as their general interest in technology is rather
low. Some participants even refused to fill out the questionnaire, when they
found out that it was about e-banking services (which they do not use at all).
Many others completed the questionnaire but skipped several parts – especially
those querying their attitude towards emerging smart banking systems. This
suggests that many seniors are not willing to deal with such systems
(independent of specific system characteristics). This is highlighted by the
following comment of a woman belonging to the ETG: "As I do not own any
electronic devices and have no internet connection at all, these questions
(remark of the authors: regarding e-banking) are not relevant to me." According
to the results of [1] that substantiate the assumption that young adults are
the target group for emerging e-banking systems, this kind of reaction is not
very surprising. Nevertheless, it has to be taken into account when
interpreting the present results. Especially the fact that no significant
differences between the younger and older generations were revealed during the
analysis of hypotheses H4 (willingness to use of e-banking services) and H5
(general affinity towards cashless payments) can be explained by the fact that mainly
technology-prone participants were considered in the group of elderly users
(ETG). Even though the ETG is not the primary target group, it is essential to
also consider their needs when designing smart banking systems.</p>

<p align="justify" style="text-indent:19.85pt;">
Our study mainly focused on how
socio-demographic factors such as age and gender influence the attitude towards
smart banking applications and the actual usage behavior. The results show that
these factors that influence attitude and usage behavior of technology in
general (see, e.g., [21], [22], [23], [24], [25], [27]) also apply to smart
banking. Related work revealed that this is not true for all factors.
Especially security and privacy concerns [28][29][30][31] play a significantly
higher role in the area of smart banking than in technology in general (see,
e.g., [5], [10], [11]). These findings have not been verified in the scope of
this study. Since they date back to 2001-2003, it needs to be checked in future
work whether these results still apply today because technology and the
attitude towards technology changed rapidly within the last decade.</p>

<p align="justify" style="text-indent:19.85pt;">
To sum up, one can advise banks
to mainly focus on applications with a high standardization and a low degree of
risk (see Table 3) since most users already accept these types of services. It
is of special importance to inspire confidence. Considering our results and
keeping the aging society (see, e.g., [32], [33], [34] or [35]) in mind, the
answer to the initially motivated research question ("Why does only a small
proportion of the Internet users also use Internet banking?") can be answered. Due
to the lack of technical experience (compare Figure 4) and perceived
learnability and usability issues (compare Figure 5), people from the ETG still
refrain from using smart banking systems.</p>
