<p align="justify"><i><strong>Abstract- </strong> A touch-based text entry method was developed with the goal of reducing the attention demand on the user. The method, called H4Touch, supports the entry of about 75 symbols and commands using only four soft keys. Each key is about 20x larger than the keys on a Qwerty soft keyboard on the same device. Symbols are entered as Huffman codes with most letters requiring just two or three taps. The codes for the letters and common commands are learned after a few hours of practice. At such time, the user can enter text while visually attending to the message, rather than the keyboard. Similar eye-on-the-message interaction is not possible with a Qwerty soft keyboard, since there are many keys and they are small. Entry speeds of 20+ wpm are possible for skilled users.</i></p>

<h2>1. Introduction</h2>

<p align="justify" style="text-indent:19.85pt;">Improving
text entry methods is among the oldest and most active areas of research in
human-computer interaction.  Even today, with the proliferation of touch-based mobile
devices, text entry remains a common and necessary task.  Whether entering a
URL, an e-mail address, a search query, or a message destined for a
friend or colleague, the interaction frequently engages the device's text entry
method to enhance the user experience.  </p>

<p align="justify" style="text-indent:19.85pt;">In
our observations of users interacting with touch-based devices, it is evident
that text is most commonly entered using a Qwerty soft keyboard, perhaps
enhanced with swipe detection [26], word completion, next key prediction [9], or
auto correction [23].  Because the keys are numerous and small, the user must
attend to the keyboard to aim at and touch the desired key.  Even highly
practiced users must attend to the keys.  There is little opportunity for
eyes-free entry, due to the number and size of the keys.  As well, the user
cannot exploit the kinesthetic sense, as with touch typing on a physical
keyboard.  Consequently, input requires a continuous switch in visual attention
– between the keyboard and the message being composed.</p>

<p align="justify" style="text-indent:19.85pt;">In
this paper, we present a touch-based text entry method that reduces the
attention demand on the user.   The method uses a soft keyboard.  However, there
are only four keys and they are big.  After a few hours of practice, the user
can fully attend to the message being composed, rather than the keyboard.  Entry
speeds exceeding 20 words per minute are possible, as demonstrated later.  The
method provides access to all the required graphic symbols, modes, and commands,
without additional keys.  </p>


<h2>2. Attention in User Interfaces</h2>

<p align="justify" style="text-indent:19.85pt;">There
is a long history of studying attention as it bears on human performance in
complex systems and environments [12].  One area of interest is divided
attention, where the human undertakes multiple tasks simultaneously.  So-called
<i>multitasking</i> or <i>time-sharing</i> [24, chapt. 8] is particularly
relevant in mobile contexts since users frequently engage in a secondary task
while using their mobile phone.  Inevitably, performance degrades in one task
or the other, perhaps both.   A particularly insidious example is texting while
driving, where statistics suggest up to a 23&times;
increase in the risk of a crash while texting [19].  The article just cited is
an example of the <i>correlational method</i> of research [13, chapt. 4], where
data are gathered and non-causal relationships are examined.  There are many
such studies on the texting-while-driving theme [e.g., 4, 17, 18], and the
conclusions are consistent: Danger looms when drivers divide their attention
between controlling their vehicle and entering information on a mobile device.</p>

<p align="justify" style="text-indent:19.85pt;">There
also studies using the <i>experimental method</i> of research [13, chapt. 4],
where an independent variable is manipulated while performance data are gather
on a dependent variable.  Conclusions of a cause-and-effect nature are
possible.  If there is an interest in, for example, "number of crashes" as a
dependent variable, then there are clearly both practical and ethical barriers
to using the experimental method in the research.  There are examples of such
research, but such studies tend to use in-lab driving simulators.  The results
are consistent with the correlational studies, although the research questions are
often narrowly focused on performance measures such as driving precision, lane
keeping, velocity variability, and so on [e.g., 10, 21, 22].</p>

<p align="justify" style="text-indent:19.85pt;">Aside
from driving, there are other situations where users engage in secondary tasks
while using a mobile device.  A common secondary task in the mobile context is
walking.  Numerous studies have examined performance effects while users walk
while performing a task on a mobile device [2, 3, 6, 8, 25].  </p>

<p align="justify" style="text-indent:19.85pt;">Our
interest in attention is more narrow.  We are looking within the text entry
task, rather than in the relationship between text entry and other tasks.  Yes,
even within the text entry task, the user is required to divide his or her
attention.  Figure&nbsp;1 illustrates.  The user is entering a message on a
touch-based mobile phone using a Qwerty soft keyboard.  As noted earlier, the
keys are numerous and small so the user's eyes are directed at the keyboard. 
Yet, the goal is creating a message, not tapping keys.  So, the user is
required to periodically shift attention to the message, to verify the
correctness of the input.</p>

<figure>
<img src="001_files/image001.jpg" class="img"/>

<figcaption>

The eye must attend to the keyboard.</figcaption>
</figure>
<br>


<p align="justify" style="text-indent:19.85pt;">In
fact, the situation is even worse.  Most contemporary text entry methods also
include word completion.  To benefit from word completion, the user must
examine a word list as entry proceeds.  The word list typically appears just
above the keyboard. Thus, the user's attention is divided among three
locations: the keyboard, the message, and the word list.  </p>

<p align="justify" style="text-indent:19.85pt;">Analyses
within the text entry task commonly consider the <i>focus of attention</i> (<i>FOA</i>). 
One distinction for FOA is between a <i>text creation</i> <i>task</i> and a <i>text
copy task</i> [16].  In a text creation task, the text originates in the user's
mind, so there is no need to visually attend to the source text.  If input uses
a regular keyboard on a desktop computer and the user possesses touch-typing
skill, the user need only focus on the typed text.  This is a one FOA task. 
However, sometimes the user is copying text which is located in a separate
space from where input occurs.  This could be a sheet of paper beside a
keyboard or text on a display.  In this case the user must focus on both the
source text and the entered text.  This is a two FOA task.   If input involves
a mobile device and a soft keyboard, the situation is different still.  A soft
keyboard cannot be operated without looking at the keys.  The user must look at
the keyboard, the source text, and the entered text.  This is a three FOA task.
  Of course, the user will divide his or her attention in whatever manner
yields reasonable and efficient input.  With word completion or prediction
added, the task becomes four FOA.  With driving or another secondary task
added, FOA is further increased.  Clearly, reducing the FOA demand on the user
is important. </p>

<p align="justify" style="text-indent:19.85pt;">An
interesting way to reduce the attention demand where word completion is used is
seen in the Qwerty soft keyboard on the BlackBerry <i>Z10</i>, released in
February 2013 (blackberry.com).  To reduce the attention required to view the
word list, predictions are dynamically positioned above the key bearing the
next letter in the word stem.  The same method is used in the <i>Octopus</i>
soft keyboard (ok.k3a.me).  For example, after entering BUS, several words appear
above keys, including "business" above "I".  See Figure&nbsp;2.  Instead of
entering the next letter by tapping I, the user may touch I and flick upward to
select "business".   With practice, entry speeds have been demonstrated to exceed
those for the Qwerty soft keyboard [5].  The important point here is that the
user is attending to the I&#8209;key, so selecting "business" does not require shifting
attention to a word list.</p>

</figure>
<br>


<p align="justify" style="text-indent:19.85pt;">While
the approach in the BlackBerry <i>Z10</i> is notable, we are taking a different
view to attention.  Our goal is to enable the user to fully attend to the
message being composed, much like the act of touch-typing on a physical
keyboard. Before describing our method, a descriptive model is presented that
relates the precision in an interaction task to the demand in visual attention.</p>


<h2>3. Frame Model of
Visual Attention</h2>

<p align="justify" style="text-indent:19.85pt;">Visual
attention is not simply a yes/no condition.  The level of visual attention will
vary according to the spatial precision demanded in the task.  To express the
idea of an attention continuum, we developed a descriptive model which we call
the <i>frame model of visual attention</i> [14].  As a descriptive model, the
goal is to support the interpretation and understanding of a problem space.  Examples
include Buxton's <i>three-state model for graphical input</i> [1] or Johansen's
<i>quadrant model for groupware</i> [11].  Descriptive models are in contrast
to predictive models [13, chapt. 7], wherein a mathematical expression is used
to predict the outcome on a human performance variable based on task
conditions.  The frame model of visual attention is shown in Figure&nbsp;3.  Four
levels are shown, but the model could be re-cast with different granularity
depending on the interactions of interest. The intent is to show a progression
in the amount of visual attention required for different classes of interaction
tasks. High demand tasks are at one end, low demand tasks at the other.  By "demand",
we refer to the amount or precision in visual attention, not to the difficulty
of the task. </p>

<p align="justify" style="text-indent:19.85pt;">The
interactions in Figure&nbsp;3 vary in the demand placed on the user to visually
attend to the location where a human responder (e.g., a finger) interacts with
a computer control (e.g., a touch-sensing display).  Tasks in the <i>point
frame</i> require a high level of precision, such as selecting a point or
pixel.  Consequently, a high level of visual attention is required.  In the <i>target
frame</i>, actions are slightly less precise, such as selecting an icon or a
key in a soft keyboard. However, the task cannot be performed reliably without
looking directly at the target; so there is still a demand on visual attention,
although less so than in the point frame.  </p>

<p align="justify" style="text-indent:19.85pt;">The
<i>surface frame</i> applies to interactions that only require a general
spatial sense of the frame or surface of a device.  Broadly-placed taps, flicks,
pinches, and most forms of gestural input apply.  The visual demand is minimal:
Peripheral vision is sufficient.  The <i>environment frame</i>, at the right in
Figure&nbsp;3, includes the user's surroundings.  Here, the visual frame of
reference encompasses the user, the device, and the environment. In most cases,
the demand for visual attention is low, and requires only peripheral vision, if
any.  Some interactions involving a device's accelerometer or camera apply.  Virtual
environments or gaming may also apply here, depending on the type of
interaction. </p>

</figure>
<br>



<p align="justify" style="text-indent:19.85pt;">As
a descriptive model, the frame model of visual attention is a tool for thinking
about interaction.  The insight gained here is that touch-based text entry with
a Qwerty soft keyboard operates in the target frame: Selecting keys requires
the user to look at the keyboard.  By relaxing the spatial precision in the
task, interaction can migrate to the surface frame, thus freeing the user from
the need to look at the keyboard.  For this, we introduce <i>H4Touch</i>.</p>

<h2>4. H4Touch</h2>


<p align="justify" style="text-indent:19.85pt;"><i>H4Touch</i> was inspired by <i>H4Writer</i>,
a text entry method using four physical keys or buttons [15].  The method uses
base-4 Huffman coding to minimize the keystrokes per character (<i>KSPC</i>)
for non-predictive English text entry.  <i>KSPC</i> = 2.321, making it slightly
less efficient than multitap on a standard phone keypad.  Bear in mind that
multitap requires nine keys, whereas <i>H4Writer</i> requires only four.   This
remarkably low <i>KSPC</i> comes by way of the base-4 Huffman algorithm:  The
top nine symbols (Space, e, t, a,
o, i, n, s, h) each require only two keystrokes yet encompass 72% of English.  A
longitudinal evaluation of <i>H4Writer</i> with six participants yielded a mean
entry speed of 20.4 wpm after ten sessions of about 40-minutes each [15].  The
evaluation used thumb input with a 4-button game controller.  <i>H4Touch</i>
seeks to leverage the performance capability of <i>H4Writer</i> to the domain
of touch input on mobile devices.  The devices of interest are smart phones,
pads, and tablets with touch-sensing displays.</p>

<p align="justify" style="text-indent:19.85pt;">Our
touch implementation uses a square grid with keys and codes assigned as in Figure&nbsp;4. 
About 75 symbols are supported, including letters, numerals, punctuation, UTF&#8209;8
symbols, Enter, Backspace, Shift, CapsLock,
etc.  Symbols not shown in Figure 4 are in a separate code tree accessed via
the Sym code (033).</p>

symbols and commands.</figcaption>
</figure>
<br>


<p align="justify" style="text-indent:19.85pt;">A
screen snap of the evaluation software running on an Android phone is shown in Figure&nbsp;5a. 
With each tap, the symbol-to-key assignments are updated to show the
progression through the Huffman code tree.  Most letters require only two or
three taps.  The software is configured to present phrases selected at random
from a set.  Timing and keystroke data are collected beginning on the first
tap, with performance data presented in a popup dialog after the last tap.</p>

<figcaption>
Figure 5. <i>H4Touch screensnaps</i>. (a) Symbol-to-key assignments are updated with each tap. (b) With experience, visual feedback is not needed.</figcaption>
</figure>
<br>


<p align="justify" style="text-indent:19.85pt;">Initial
entry is visually guided, as users learn the codes for letters and common
commands.   Learning, then, takes place in the target frame, as depicted in Figure&nbsp;3. 
 Common letters and words are learned quickly.  At this point, the user has memorized
the most common codes.  And it is at this point that the most interesting
aspect of <i>H4Touch</i> appears. Interaction migrates to the surface frame
(see Figure&nbsp;3) as the user now visually attends to the message, rather
than to the keyboard. Of course, mistakes are made, but the feedback is
immediate because the user is attending to the message.  There is no need to
switch attention between the keyboard and the message.  </p>

<p align="justify" style="text-indent:19.85pt;">Not
only are visual key assignments not needed for experienced users, they are
potentially annoying.  The preferred mode of interaction after a few hours of
practice is seen in Figure&nbsp;5b where the rendering of symbol-to-key assignments
is suppressed.  Of course, this is a choice to be made by the user.  In the
evaluation software, this option ("Hide letters") is enabled through a checkbox
user preference.  We should add that suppressing the output of symbol-to-key
assignments only affects letters.  Even experienced users are likely to need
the key symbols when entering some of the more esoteric symbols or commands,
which begin with Sym (033).</p>

<p align="justify" style="text-indent:19.85pt;">We
offer Figure 6 for comparison with Figure&nbsp;1 and to echo this paper's
title.  With <i>H4Touch</i>, the user's eye is on the message, not the
keyboard.  Of course, the caveat "after a few hours of practice" holds.  More
correctly, the caveat is "after a few hours of practice <i>and for all
interaction thereafter</i>".  </p>

<img src="001_files/image007.jpg" class="img"/>

</figure>
<br>


<p align="justify" style="text-indent:19.85pt;">No
amount of practice with a Qwerty soft keyboard allows for a similar
experience.  There are simply too many keys and they are too small.  By way of
comparison, Figure&nbsp;7 shows a single <i>H4Touch</i> key and a key from a
Qwerty soft keyboard, with dimensions as measured on a Google <i>Nexus 4</i> in
portrait mode.  The <i>H4Touch</i> key is about 20&times;
larger.</p>

<br>

<h2>5. User Experience</h2>

<p align="justify" style="text-indent:19.85pt;">There
are several techniques to improve the user experience with <i>H4Touch</i>.  One
technique is to use feedback to convey a sense of progress as text entry proceeds. 
Of course, the primary visual feedback is the appearance of text in the message
being composed.  As well, auditory and vibrotactile feedback options are
selectable via checkboxes in a user preferences dialog.  The feedback is
provided on the last tap in a code sequence – after the second or third
tap for most letters (see Figure&nbsp;4).  Intermediate feedback is provided by
displaying the key code in red on the <i>H4Touch</i> keyboard.  See Figure&nbsp;8a. 
</p>

<p align="justify" style="text-indent:19.85pt;">Providing
an option for two-thumb input in landscape mode is also important.  See Figure&nbsp;8b. 
There is the potential for faster entry with two thumbs, but testing for this
with <i>H4Touch</i> has not been done. </p>

<h2>6. Extensibility</h2>

<p align="justify" style="text-indent:19.85pt;"><i>H4Touch</i> currently supports about 75
symbols and commands. As noted in the original design of <i>H4Writer</i>, letter
codes were generated using the base&#8209;4 Huffman algorithm along with letter
probabilities for English [15].  The 0-branch of the code tree was hidden from
the algorithm and manually designed later to include codes for commands and
other symbols.  The most common UTF-8 symbols are included in a "symbol tree" (Sym = 033). It is a simple process to
extend the codes to include additional symbols, such as accented characters or
other symbols from the broader set of Unicodes (e.g., UTF-16).  For example,
the symbol tree currently includes the dollar sign ("$" = 2200).  To include
symbols for other currencies, the codes may be adjusted as follows:</p>

<p align="center">
$ = 22000<br />
€ = 22001<br />
&#8356; = 22002<br />
¥ = 22003</p>

<p align="justify" style="text-indent:19.85pt;">Other
design issues are pending, such as including code trees for other scripts,
selected on an as-needed basis.</p>

<h2>7. User Performance</h2>

<p align="justify" style="text-indent:19.85pt;">Preliminary
testing with a user who has about 10 hours of practice suggests that entry
speeds of 20 wpm are readily achievable.  The codes are identical to those used
with <i>H4Writer</i> and the interactions very similar: the index finger on 4
soft keys for <i>H4Touch</i> vs. the thumb on 4 physical buttons for <i>H4Writer</i>. 
Thus, the performance and learning trends demonstrated with <i>H4Writer</i> are
expected to hold for <i>H4Touch</i>.  Figure&nbsp;9 provides examples of popup
dialogs that appear after the input of sample phrases.  These results are
consistent with the initial evaluation of <i>H4Writer</i> [15]. The
data collected for the left-side example in Figure 9 are illustrated in Figure
10. </p>

Figure 10. Keystrokes, characters, and time for input of an example phrase using <i>H4Touch</i>.<br /> See also Figure 9.</figcaption>
</figure>
<br>



<p align="justify" style="text-indent:19.85pt;">The phrase included 31 characters which were entered in
17.37 seconds with 76 keystrokes (finger taps).  The codes for each character
are given in Figure&nbsp;4.  Relevant human performance statistics include
entry speed, error rate, keystroke rate, and keystrokes per character (<i>KSPC</i>). 
The entry speed was (31 / 5) / (17.37 / 60) = 21.42 words per minute, as seen
in the popup dialog in Figure&nbsp;9.  The phrase was entered without errors,
so the error rate was 0.0% (without any extra taps to correct errors).   The
keystroke rate was 76 / 17.37 = 4.4 keystrokes per second.  This is fast but is
well within the human capability for tapping, which peaks at about 6.5 taps per
second.</p>

<p align="justify" style="text-indent:19.85pt;">Keystrokes
per character (<i>KSPC</i>) is both an <i>analytic metric</i> and an <i>empirical
measure</i>.  As an analytic metric, <i>KSPC</i> is defined as the number of
keystrokes required, on average, for each character of text produced using a
given input method using a given language.  Used in this manner, <i>KSPC</i> is
computed by analysis – without observing or measuring actual input from users. 
As noted in Section 4, <i>KSPC</i> = 2.321 for <i>H4Writer</i> [15]. The same value holds for <i>H4Touch</i>,
since the number of keys, the codes, and the language are the same.  As an
empirical measure, <i>KSPC</i> is calculated by observing interaction and
gathering relevant data.  The relevant data are the number of keystrokes
entered and the number of characters produced.  For the example in Figure 10, <i>KSPC</i>
= 76 / 31 = 2.452.  The analytic and empirical measures are slightly different,
since the analytic measure is an overall average and the empirical measure is
for a specific phrase of input.  <i>KSPC</i> will rise if errors are made and
corrected, but this was not observed for the phrases in Figure&nbsp;9.</p>

<p align="justify" style="text-indent:19.85pt;">On
a technical note, it is worth mentioning that initial tests of <i>H4Touch</i>
on Android devices were disappointing.  Although the evaluation software worked
fine, the user experience suffered because the devices were unable to "keep
up".  Quick, light taps were occasionally missed, and this forced the user to
slow down and to tap with slightly more, yet unnatural, force.  This has
changed with recent multi-core devices, such as the Google <i>Nexus 4</i>,
which is quad-core and has a sensor sampling rate of 200 Hz.  The device easily
senses taps that are quick and light.  The user experience with <i>H4Touch</i>
is transparent: Performance is a human factor, not a technology factor.</p>

<h2>8. Conclusion</h2>

<p align="justify" style="text-indent:19.85pt;">We
presented <i>H4Touch</i>, a 4-key touch-based text entry method for smart phones,
tabs, and tablets. After a few hours of practice, the codes for the letters and
common commands are memorized.  Thereafter the user can enter text while
visually attending to the message being composed, rather than the keyboard.  A
full evaluation was not undertaken, since <i>H4Touch</i> uses the same number
of keys and the same codes as <i>H4Writer</i>.  The latter method demonstrated
performance of 20.4 wpm after ten sessions of practice.  This is expected to
hold for <i>H4Touch</i> and was demonstrated in testing with a single user.  </p>

<p align="justify" style="text-indent:19.85pt;">A
web site is setup to provide free access to the <i>H4Touch</i> software,
including the source code file for the evaluation software (see Figures 5, 8,
and 9) and the binary (apk) code for an input method editor
(IME).  The IME is a soft keyboard that allows system-wide text entry in any
application using <i>H4Touch</i>.</p>
