<h4>1. Introduction</h4>

<p class="body"> Capstone courses for
undergraduate students provide undeniable learning benefits, and are considered
among the best high impact learning practices in undergraduate education [1, 2,
3]. In addition to providing a &quot;springboard for connecting learning to the
world beyond campus&quot;, [1] capstones are an excellent way to assess the
success of student learning in the major [4, 3, 5, 6, 7, 8], and many
institutions increasingly require capstone courses or experiences for senior
level, undergraduate students. According to the 2011 National Survey of Senior
Capstone Experiences, 268 of 276 responding institutions offer a capstone
experience [9], and the effectiveness of capstone experiences at increasing
levels of engagement and to create deep learning has been documented in
national surveys [1]. In fact, the 2008 AAC&amp;U's LEAP studies on High Impact
Educational Practices finds that one of the most effective ways to enhance
student engagement and increase student success is to &quot;make it possible
for every student to participate in at least two high-impact activities during
his or her undergraduate program &quot; one in the first year and one later on
such as a culminating experience [1]. </p>

<p class="body">But what are the most effective
delivery methods for capstone courses, and can they, in a time of high demand
for online learning, be as effective when offered in non-traditional formats as
when they are taught in traditional classroom settings? What do student
learning outcomes indicate about some of the most effective formats for
delivering a capstone learning experience? In addition, can answers to these
questions inform programmatic curriculum design?</p>

<p class="body">In 2008, The University of North
Dakota (UND), a comprehensive research university with over 15,000 students
enrolled in undergraduate, graduate and professional and medical programs, put
into place its revised General Education program with an emphasis on
encouraging students to experience general education learning goals throughout
their entire undergraduate experience. Several new requirements were added to
the program that has now been titled Essential Studies, the most exciting of
which is a senior capstone experience. This decision has been especially
noteworthy since only approximately 17.9% of surveyed institutions serving over
3,000 students offer capstone courses for all undergraduates [9]. To help
provide capstone experiences, a three-credit interdisciplinary capstone,
Writing Across Disciplines, was developed in the Humanities &amp; Integrated
Studies unit at UND. Meant to bring students from many varied majors together
to dialogue on the goals and methodologies of their disciplines and to examine
where and how these goals intersect, this capstone became the first
cross-disciplinary capstone offered at UND and the only capstone
to be offered in three different ways: online, on-ground, and in an
on-ground/online hybrid format. At the University of North Dakota, traditional
face-to-face classes are referred to as &quot;on-ground&quot;; courses entirely
offered in a non-face-to-face, asynchronous, online format are referred to as
&quot;online&quot;; and courses that blend both face-to-face group learning
with asynchronous, non-face-to face, online components are referred to as
&quot;hybrid&quot; courses.</p>

<p class="body">To determine which platform was most effective for helping
students achieve their learning goals, a pilot study of the learning outcomes
was created to compare the three formats and try to judge the preliminary
effectiveness of each. All three courses are taught by the same professor, and
use the same texts and assignment prompts and emphasize the same learning
goals. However, necessarily, the methods for students interacting with each
other, with the texts and topics, and with the assignments themselves differ
according to each delivery method. Direct assessments have been done on student
learning outcomes from each type of course delivery. </p>

<p class="body">Additionally, by analyzing
assignments and by comparing those results with student feedback from these
courses, instructors are beginning to better understand which course formats
and which types of assignments are the most effective at helping students hone
capstone level abilities in writing, critical thinking, and integrative
learning. Though not all capstones may strive to help students meet these same
academic goals, the findings here should help instructors think about how best
to create capstone assignments and to develop methodologies that are meaningful
and effective for the common capstone student learning outcomes. Additionally,
the findings from this study provide insight into larger, programmatic
curriculum design in lower level courses and will help in the formulation of
the learning outcomes for this course and other capstones. It will allow the
faculty to construct an assessment program that allows them to determine most
effective methods of course formats, to add to the dialogue around effective
methods for teaching highly student centered classes/learning community based
classes and to contribute to the growing body of knowledge about the
effectiveness of online teaching.</p>

<p class="body">  Another unique aspect of this
study, is that Humanities &amp; Integrated Studies is a department that
believes strongly in student centered learning, interactive learning
communities, and high levels of faculty engagement with students.  These are
hallmarks of all of the classes taught in this unit. So, if a capstone course
is offered in a seemingly less-personal, less immediate format, like an online
format, could it foster the same levels of student learning and could it be as
successful as its traditional counterpart? Answering this question could
provide units that emphasize a learning community approach with cost effective
ways to reach more students while still maintaining the outcomes that
student-centered, learning community practices engender.</p>





<h4> 2. Background </h4>

<p class="body">The effectiveness of online
courses, and distance education in general, has been a topic of intense study
for the past several decades.  While early distance education experiences often
relied solely on audio or video recordings, textbooks, workbooks, and other
"low tech" strategies, today's online learning applications provide diverse
learning opportunities through applications such as course management systems,
video streaming, educational games, chats, wikis, blogs, and personal response
systems.  It has been suggested that online educational technologies are often
better than conventional instruction approaches [10, 11].  However, the
historical context of studies investigating the effectiveness of online or
distance education should be taken into account when interpreting results of
those studies.</p>

<p class="body">Although numerous reports
describe instructional approaches taken in online capstone courses [12, 13, 14,
15], relatively little is known specifically about the effectiveness of online
senior-level integrative capstone courses at helping students achieve stated
learning goals and little has been done to look at learning outcomes in virtual
or hybrid learning communities [16, 17].  Most studies of online learning in
general indicate that learning outcomes in purely online courses, or even
hybrid courses (ones that incorporate components of online and traditional
on-ground, face-to-face interaction) tend to be at least comparable to those in
purely on-ground courses.  For example, a recent meta-analysis examined the
effectiveness of purely online and hybrid courses compared to traditional
on-ground (face-to-face) courses [18].   Ultimately, this analysis focused on
45 studies published between 1996 and 2008.  Online learning (including purely
online as well as hybrid courses) on average yielded higher learning outcomes
than solely face-to-face instruction.  Furthermore, the hybrid courses showed a
larger advantage compared to pure face-to-face instruction than did pure online
courses. </p>

<p class="body">Other meta-analyses based on
earlier distance education literature reported results similar to those
mentioned above [19, 20, 11].  In addition, asynchronous instruction, with a
lag between instruction periods (posting of information, assignments, etc.),
had a small positive effect on student performance whereas synchronous
instruction (where instruction and student response occur in real time) had a
small negative [19, 21].</p>

<p class="body">There has been a shift in online
learning environments over the past few decades from information transmission
to more interactive and collaborative learning with the online technologies
that have become increasingly available.  The term &quot;online learning
communities&quot; refers to coordinated face-to-face and virtual interactions
among a cohort of learners led by one or more instructors [22, 23].  It has
been suggested that effective learning, especially when dealing with complex,
multidimensional issues, takes place best in learning communities and that online
learning can effectively provide such communities [23, 24, 25]. This pilot
study seeks, in part, to make initial determinations about whether or not new,
more collaborative technologies could be utilized in online and hybrid
classrooms to produce acceptable or, perhaps, even improved, student learning
outcomes.</p>






<h4> 3. Course Formats and Learning Goals </h4>

<p class="body">The "Writing Across
Disciplines" capstone was created to meet the emerging criteria of UND's
Essential Studies (general education) capstone requirement and is, thus, a
course that provides students in their senior year, who have completed basic
required writing courses, with an upper-level, intense writing experience that
focuses on the methods and strategies of writing in the Humanities, Social
Sciences, and Sciences. It also asks students to engage in the process of
integrating interdisciplinary materials and writing tactics as well as to
formulate written responses to topics of current concern in individual and in
collaborative assignments. Students enrolled in this course come from a wide
range of majors including (but not limited to) Communications, Forensic
Science, Physical Education and Exercise Science, Recreation and Tourism
Studies, Physics, English and General Studies. They may or may not have had prior
experience in student-centered interdisciplinary classes. As was stated
previously, the course is taught in three ways, but all courses use the same
texts and assignments and emphasize the same learning goals, which are that
students will:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Appreciate and respond to diverse audiences and diverse perspectives</li>
  <li>Use reading and writing to develop critical thinking skills through inquiry, learning, thinking, communicating and collaborative work</li>
  <li>Understand writing as an on-going process</li>
  <li>Use research to develop, support and enhance ideas, while using the appropriate writing conventions required by different disciplines</li>
  <li>Understand the value of multiple perspectives regarding complex issues and problems</li>
</ul>

<p class="body">The courses necessarily differ, however, in how students
work to meet these learning goals and how they respond to each other, the
texts, and the assignments. This table below provides an overview comparison of
the course structures, and a detailed discussion of each format follows.</p>

<p class="subhead"> 3.1. The On-ground Version </p>

<p class="body">The original format for the
course embraces traditional classroom practice, bringing a small group of
senior students from a variety of majors together to read, discuss and write
about topics and readings in each of the main disciplinary areas
of Humanities, Social Science, and Science. </p>

<p class="body">The on-ground version of the
course integrates short readings from the varied disciplinary areas including a
short novel, a vignette, non-fiction articles and a play in addition to other
short readings. The assignments involve in-class discussions and activities, in
addition to both informal and formal writings which take the forms of in-class
short writing assignments, personal reflection, letters to the author,
individual and collaborative presentations, and individually and
collaboratively written formal essays as well as student-to-student peer review
memos and face-to-face conferences. In short, the intent is to introduce a
variety of writing formats, encourage critical reading and reflection,
encourage students to consider their readings from alternative perspectives and
foster a collaborative classroom environment focused on developing strong
written and oral communication skills. Instruction in this format is for this
course is synchronous, where instruction and student responses occur in real
time.</p>

<p class="subhead"> 3.2. The Online Version </p>

<p class="body">The need for non-disciplinary
capstone courses that could be taken online soon developed. The faculty and
staff of Humanities &amp; Integrated Studies decided to hire an expert online
educator and online course developer to translate the class material into this
format and to become the main instructor for both the on-ground and online
versions.</p>

<p class="body">While the online version is
similar in content to the on-ground version of the course, the course delivery
is totally asynchronous, with a lag between instruction and student response,
and it is solely focused in the online course forum (Blackboard).  Students who
may be located in various other states or countries never meet face-to-face
and, therefore, the necessary interaction is facilitated solely in the online
forum. The course integrates the same short readings as the online courses from
the varied disciplinary areas including a short novel, a vignette, non-fiction
articles and a play in addition to other short readings. The assignments
involve both informal and formal writings which take the forms of blogs,
personal reflection, letters to the author, individual and collaborative
presentations, more structured weekly writings, and individually and collaboratively
written formal essays as well as responses to classmates' writings and
student-to-student peer review memos with a strong emphasis placed on student
interaction in the online forum. In short, the intent is to introduce a variety
of writing formats, encourage critical reading and reflection, encourage
students to consider their readings from alternative perspectives, and focus on
improving digital communication skills through the introduction of digital
collaboration tools. Through the online version of the course, the students
obviously must rely on written communication and so are constantly thinking
about their own writing, reading their classmates' writing, and are writing
continuously throughout the entire term. </p>

<p class="subhead"> 3.3. The Hybrid Version </p>

<p class="body">The online course was very
successful, with students demanding and filling multiple sections. As faculty
began to consider the success of the course, it was noted that some of the
mechanisms used in the online course, like the blog postings and challenge writing
assignments seemed to encourage and sharpen certain abilities such as writing
itself, counter-argumentation, and reflection on other's writing styles in
relation to their own. Could it be that the necessary methods of online
learning actually enhance overall learning in the course? With a strong
pedagogical belief in maintaining the close student-to-student and
student-to-faculty interactions of a learning community, instructors decided to
experiment by creating a hybrid course where students would meet face-to-face
for three week blocks with additional online writing assignments alternated
with work solely done online for three week blocks, thereby combining what they
believed to be the best of both online learning and on-ground classroom
practices. </p>

<p class="body">The hybrid version of the course
integrates both the face-to-face interaction in the classroom through
discussion, individual and collaborative presentations, and face-to-face/memo
peer review with the same short readings from the varied disciplinary areas
including a short novel, a vignette, non-fiction articles and a play in
addition to other short readings. The assignments involve in-class discussions
and activities as well as both informal and formal online writings which take
the forms of blogs, personal reflection, letters to the author, more structured
weekly writings, and individually and collaboratively written formal essays as
well as responses to classmates' writings and student-to-student peer review
memos, creating space for both synchronous and asynchronous instruction and
learning. In short, the intent is to introduce a variety of writing formats,
provide opportunities for writing and reading one another's writings, encourage
critical reading and reflection, encourage students to consider their readings
from alternative perspectives, while still capitalizing on the benefits of
face-to-face interaction.</p>






<h4>4. Comparing Direct Student Learning Outcomes: Methodology </h4>

<p class="body"> Though capstones are regularly
used, and often solely created, as assessment mechanisms for learning in the
major or for programmatic review of majors or of general education, until
recently, &quot;research on capstone experiences is scant&quot; [1]. Just as in any course, however, direct assessment of
student learning artifacts is essential to identifying best practices in the
classroom and to studying the overall effectiveness of the course to meet the
prescribed learning goals, and, of course, to revise practices or materials as
needed to help students better meet these goals [8, 26].  In the case of these
three formats, if the mechanisms for delivery or response in one version
indicates better learning outcomes than another, it would be important to
revise the other versions of the course, where possible, to take advantage of
these mechanisms. This pilot study was approved by the University of North
Dakota's Institutional Review Board.</p>

<p class="body">The online version of the course
has been offered multiple times. The on-ground and hybrid version have each
been offered once. This pilot study utilized direct measures for learning
outcomes using the pre-/post-design that has become the standard for college
effective studies [27]. For each version of the course, including two sections
of the online course, formal writing assignments from the beginning and from the
end of the semester were collected, and a random sample of one quarter of the
papers for each assignment, each semester, each version were selected. The
AAC&amp;U rubrics for Writing, Critical Thinking, and Integrative Learning were
selected for assessment use since the course grading rubrics and assignment
formats emphasized learning outcomes based on these rubrics [28].  Each rubric
ranks multiple criteria in each category on a scale from 0-4. A
student-friendly version of these rubrics was provided to students at the
beginning of the semester, used for each evaluation, and utilized by the
students in each peer-editing situation, so they were thoroughly familiar with
the evaluation criteria.</p>

<p class="body">For the purposes of this pilot study, an outside expert who
utilizes similar teaching techniques, uses the same assessment rubrics, and was
instrumental in overall course development, was selected to assess the papers. 
All identifying information was removed from the papers and several were
selected for a norming session, where the course instructor and the outside
expert applied the rubrics and compared and normed results to ensure that the
rubrics were being accurately applied.</p>

<p class="body">Formal papers were selected from
the beginning and from the end of each semester. The first assignment was taken
from the beginning of the semester and asked the students to begin with an
important quotation from a selected Humanities text and explore the meaning and
relevance of that quote in terms of the work, of their own experience, and of
the wider world. The second assignment was the final assignment for the
semester and required that students explore an issue of particular concern or
interest encountered in the course and examine that topic from an
interdisciplinary perspective, demonstrating how experts in different fields
would address the topic and drawing conclusions with regard to those
disciplines.</p>

<p class="body">Papers were numbered, recorded by
section, and then randomly shuffled by a third party before being distributed
to the expert reviewer to eliminate knowledge of course version. The papers
were all assessed and ranked according to each of the criteria (writing,
critical thinking, and integrative learning). Results were averaged overall in
each category and comparisons were made among course versions as well as
between initial and final assignments within each course.  One-way analysis of
variance (ANOVA) and Mann-Whitney analyses were used to test for differences
among average rank responses. </p>






<h4> 5. Results &amp; Discussion </h4>

<p class="body"> Average rankings of assessment
criteria reveal noteworthy differences in student performance (and gains) among
the online, on-ground, and hybrid courses (Figure 1).  Averages for the first
paper did indicate lower than expected levels in all three areas (averages on
this assignment ranged from 2.04±0.40 to 2.26±0.30 (mean ± standard error) on a
scale of 0 to 4).  Interestingly, performance on the first paper in all three
areas was statistically comparable among all course versions (ANOVA and
Mann-Whitney tests, p &gt; 0.05).  These results suggest that regardless of
type of course enrolled in, students do not come in to the capstone experience
with adequate experience and skills, a finding that corroborates the results of
other capstone assessments [29, 30, 3, 4].</p>

Average rankings of each of the three skills demonstrated in the first paper were not significantly different among course versions (one-way ANOVA, p > 0.05).  For the final paper, writing and integration skills in the fall 2011 (online) course were significantly higher than the on-ground course  (Mann-Whitney test, p < 0.05). </figcaption>
</figure>


<p class="body">Comparisons of first and last
papers reveal a demonstrated increase in learning outcomes in all course
versions.  Average rankings increased in all three areas of writing, critical
thinking, and integrative learning with students nearing the rank of 4 or
&quot;capstone&quot; benchmark on the final paper for learning outcomes in each
area as defined by AAC&amp;U.   Interestingly, average rankings for the final
paper were significantly higher for all three skills than on the first paper in
the fall 2011 (online) course (Mann-Whitney test, p &lt; 0.05).  This trend was
also observed in the hybrid course as the average rank for thinking skills was
significantly higher for the last paper than the first paper (Mann-Whitney
test, p &lt; 0.05).  Although the fall 2012 (online) and the on-ground courses
also showed increased rankings by the end of the semester, they were not
statistically significant (Mann-Whitney test, p &gt; 0.05).</p>

<p class="body">Performance comparisons on the
final paper reveal noteworthy differences among the three course versions. 
Average rankings of both online courses (Fall 2011 and Fall 2012) for writing,
thinking, and integration skills were found to be statistically comparable
(Mann-Whitney test, p &gt; 0.05).  Therefore, performance results were
consistent between the two semesters the online version was offered.  Overall,
average rankings for the online courses tended to be higher than both the
on-ground and hybrid versions while rankings for the on ground course tended to
be the lowest of the three course versions (Figure 1).  Average rankings for
the hybrid course were more comparable to the online course than the on-ground
course.  Although differences were observed among average rankings on the final
paper, only two comparisons showed significant differences (namely writing and
integration skills were significantly higher in the fall 2011 online course
than the on-ground course (Mann-Whitney test, p &lt; 0.05).</p>

<p class="body">Though, the factors of student
background, GPA, and gender were not controlled for, all courses had the same
number of students, and there were a predominance of similar majors across all
versions. Additionally, students were selected from cohorts that were
contemporary, meaning that all students underwent similar university academic
experiences within a contiguous timeframe.  In this pilot study, only materials
from one of each of the course versions was used, since the hybrid and onground
versions had only been taught once. Thus, comparing one of each of the courses
taught within the same time span would, it was believed, yield the best data
for guiding future assessment work.</p>

<p class="body"> That the online version of the
course was at least equal to, if not better than, the on-ground version in
producing improved student learning outcomes in all three learning areas,
reflects national findings [2, 31, 32].  The nature of the online learning
environment has been one that has come under extensive scrutiny in an attempt
to compare the online learning experience with the traditional on-ground
experience [2, 31, 32].  While some studies have found "no significant
difference" in the quantitative learning outcomes of online and on-ground
students, the quantitative data shows something different with online students
indicating greater satisfaction and success with "well designed" online course
experiences [2, 3, 31, 32, 33, 34, 35]. In this pilot study, these quantitative
findings were reflected across the board with student self evaluations given at
the end of the semester.  Student pre- and post-writing assignments and
reflective comments illustrate recognition by the students of the progress made
in all areas of writing, critical thinking and integration.</p>

<p class="body"> With the proliferation of
technology, the Internet and online learning tools, it is possible to create a
richer, more interactive and engaging environment for students to develop
writing skills and complete capstone experiences. However, this plethora of
resources and new technological advancements require substantial instructional
design to integrate structure, course material, increase familiarity between
the students and with the tools available [3, 6, 32, 35, 36]. This can be
effectively translated to online writing courses as well [36] including
capstone courses. </p>

<p class="body"> The potential for increased
benefits in the online version may also be due to the asynchronous nature of
the course. When students can approach course material and engage in course
work at the most optimal times for their learning styles and lifestyles, they
may be more likely to produce work that is better than it would be in
synchronous learning environments when work must be accomplished on the
instructor's or institution's timeframe and not the students. Additionally, the
asynchronous format is &quot;much more conducive to the expansion of learning
time, thereby providing more opportunity for student reflection and response"
[6, 34, 35, 37, 38].</p>

<p class="body">The focus on the written word in
the online learning forum emphasizes reading and writing, as opposed to
speaking and listening in the on-ground and hybrid formats, which impacts the
way that learning occurs.  Students in an online learning forum cannot
necessarily rely on others to carry the discussion because each student is
required to complete the written assignment and post responses to their
classmates [36].  The "piggy back" nature of the discussion allows for
development and recording of asynchronous discussion in the online environment
over time for the students to revisit and reconnect with at any time during the
term [38]. Additionally, this kind of layering or building up of communications
over time to develop each assignment requires that students read each others'
writings and, therefore, necessarily become more deeply familiar with each
others' ideas in order to formulate individual responses and write
assignments.  This deep learning and necessary familiarization with others'
ideas accomplishes, to a strong degree, what in-class socialization does: it
allows students to form a learning community. They become connected through the
process of reading and responding to each others' postings. Of course to have
this occur, the course must be well constructed so that it requires this
constant reading and revisiting of others' work [34, 35, 38].</p>






<h4>6. Plans for Expansion of the Study </h4>

<p class="body">The results of this study are
indicative of the need to pursue a larger-scale program of assessment. Though
preliminary findings indicate that online and hybrid writing-intensive
capstones provide students with high quality learning experiences, continuing
the study and drawing from multiple sections over time will help faculty determine
if these findings are robust if they persist.</p>

<p class="body"> In addition to studying the
student learning outcomes via assessment of learning artifacts, additional data
about students would help lend perspective to the findings. In the next, larger
scale assessment, information on student demographics will be added, including
information on GPAs, gender, and previous experience in writing and
discussion-based courses. Analyses of these additional variables may help
pinpoint some of the factors associated with effective demonstration of
learning outcomes at the capstone level.</p>

<p class="body">Additionally, since, in this
pilot study, the onground and the hybrid courses had only been offered one
time, materials drawn from subsequently taught courses should yield more robust
information. Once the hybrid course is more systematically taught, the
possibilities of any unevenness due to instructor issues (e.g. being new to the
hybrid format, etc.) will be more easily controlled for. The faculty now plans
to collect data from all sections of all formats of the course, choose random
samples, and evaluate them so that a more robust pool of information can be
compared.</p>

<p class="body">Additionally, to further pursue
the effect of online formats on learning community engagement, a survey of
student perceptions of learning and engagement will be conducted and analyzed,
using responses from students enrolled in all three course formats. This mixed
methods approach will provide valuable insight for other institutions that wish
to create capstone experiences in an online learning environment.</p>





<h4>7. Conclusion </h4>

<p class="body">An overall analysis in this pilot
study indicates that the learning outcomes in the hybrid course tended to equal
those in the online course in most areas, and results would indicate that
offering the on campus version of the course in the hybrid, rather than the
full on-ground version, would be more beneficial to students. The hybrid
version of the class allows for the integration of the different in-class and
online activities and strategies to reinforce and supplement the objectives and
goals of the capstone experience.  For many students this mix encourages
consideration of the course material beyond the class period and keeps students
more engaged over the entire course of the term as they prepare the online
assignments than the solely on-ground version of the course, which does not
include this component. Additionally, the emphasis placed on writing, online
discussion, and peer review through the online portions of the class provided
opportunity for improved and continuous writing in a variety of informal and
formal formats over the course of the term, as well as opportunities for
revisiting and reflecting on past writings. Students also maintain a visual
record of their writing progress over the entire term as they develop writing,
critical thinking and integration skills.  By revisiting past writings and
evaluating their own progress, students are able to see improvements in their
own writing, while also see improvements and stylistic differences in their
classmates' writings. </p>

<p class="body"> In all three versions of the
course, students' averages for writing, critical thinking, and integrative
learning were lower than expected for the first assignment. This indicates that
more reverse programmatic curriculum planning needs to occur at every level of
Essential Studies course work to provide students with more opportunity to
develop these skills before reaching the capstone.</p>

<p class="body">As for the best format for
offering a capstone course that emphasizes writing, critical thinking and/or
integrative learning skills for student learning goals, the online and hybrid
method offer at least as good a learning experience, if not perhaps, an
increased benefit, when compared to the on-ground course. Though, as indicated,
a further, more detailed assessment will be undertaken, these results indicate
that in some circumstances students can gain as much learning benefit, if not
perhaps more, from well-constructed online or hybrid learning experiences as
they can in a face-to-face class.  The creation of true learning communities in
the virtual world does seem to be effective and may even provide students with
more opportunities and space for reflection, leading them to greater learning
gains overall.</p>
