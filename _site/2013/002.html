    <p class="body"><b>Abstract</b> - <i>Persons older than 75 years of age are more susceptible to falls and are a greater burden to the healthcare system than their younger counterparts. While devices like the Nintendo Wii can potentially increase balance control, virtual reality games available for the Wii are not designed as exercise therapy programmes for older people. Targeted therapies are more likely to increase function and decrease falls risk. An interdisciplinary approach that integrates the knowledge of engineers with clinicians can enable the development of a virtual reality home-based exercise programme with off-the-shelf equipment. Two targeted exercise therapy games have been developed to encourage at home exercise using novel software with Wii balance boards. One requires stability and balance in a standing position, while the other trains stepping reactions. Ethics approval was obtained to evaluate and pilot these games with older participants. These games were shown to be effective during user testing in that five individuals have provided feedback for further improvement and are interested in participating in a longer balance and exercise programme using these games. One participant was also involved in testing the device in his home environment over the course of a few days. Initial testing in the home environment exposed issues that were not present in the laboratory environment which supports the need for user testing at a very early stage in the prototype development.</i></p>

<h4>1. Introduction</h4>



<p class="body">Up to 35% of all older people fall every
year and 68% of fallers sustain an injury with a resultant loss in function and
independence [1]. Many of these falls are preventable but an engaging, cost
effective programme of sufficient intensity to safely reinforce balance control
strategies does not exist. While
traditional methods of therapy have been shown to be effective, there is often
a lack of adherence in home-based exercises [2-4]. In an attempt to reduce the
load on the therapist and provide a more cost-effective means of therapy,
technologies have been introduced including robotics [5-7] and virtual reality [8-10].
Rather than undergoing
robotic therapies in a clinic environment, there has also been promise in the
areas of gaming and virtual reality with readily available technologies like
the Wii [10-13], the Sony EyeToy [8, 14-16] and more recently the Xbox Kinect [17].
These devices have been shown to be safe and feasible for home-based therapy
treatment, but off-the-shelf systems may not provide enough flexibility to
allow a therapist to modify the exercise programme if the participant finds the
exercises too difficult or gains enough confidence to attempt more challenging
exercises. In addition, the feedback provided may not be sufficient to engage
the user effectively [6, 18, 19] as the games often provide a score for a
specific game rather than comparative scores over a given timeframe which shows
improvement. The benefits of these technologies are that they are inexpensive
and can be easily implemented in the home environment. If designed effectively
they are also more enjoyable which may lead to increased adherence.</p>

<p class="body">A
systematic review conducted by the University of Melbourne [20] found that
studies to evaluate the benefits of virtual reality and gaming by older people
are of moderate to low quality. While 17 studies used off-the-shelf technology
to promote exercise activity in participants over 45 years of age, no studies
evaluated the effect on activity or participation, and only three showed
improved balance; each using different outcome measures including the Berg
Balance Scale, single leg stance on each leg and gait improvement. A more
recent RCT examining sway during balance has found that exercises with the Sony
Eye Toy reduces the medial lateral sway length (the direction of sway most
associated with falls risk)[21]. </p>

<h4>2.     Background</h4>

<p class="body">Up to 35% of all older people (&gt;65
years) fall every year and 68% of fallers sustain an injury with a resultant
loss in function and independence [1]. Many falls are preventable. An engaging,
cost-effective programme of sufficient intensity to safely reinforce balance
control strategies for older people does not exist. Compared to non-fallers, fallers have
reduced lower-limb strength, slowed voluntary reaction time, and reduced
sensory acuity and balance. Exercise programmes have been shown to be effective
in improving balance and strength, and in reducing the number of falls [22-24].
But such training protocols are not specific enough to induce adaptations in
neuromuscular capacities that are required in actual balance-recovery reactions
(e.g. abilities to recover balance) [25, 26]. Recent studies indicate that
perturbation-based or multitask balance training have the potential to improve
these specific capacities because they comply with the principle of training
specificity [27]. Such findings support the view that training to promote more
effective change-in-support reactions may help to reduce the risk of falls, and
hence should be included as part of a falls prevention programme. Targeted
stepping actions in therapy programmes therefore have the potential to reduce
the number of falls.  </p>

<p class="body">Evaluating the size of step required to
recover, it has been found that larger, faster steps increase the ability to
recover balance [28]. Increasing strength in
targeted muscle groups has also shown improvements in gait speed, stride
length, cadence, and clearance [29]. Such findings support the view that training to promote more
effective change-in-support reactions may help to reduce the risk of falls, and
hence should be included as part of a falls prevention programme. However, training of
balance-recovery reactions and stepping in a safe but engaging manner at
sufficient intensity to have an effect on the older person's balance remain
problematic.</p>

<p class="subhead">2.1 Exercise and Falls</p>


<p class="body">The
World Report on Disability argues that exercise therapy can improve not only
functional outcomes across a wide cross section of health conditions, but
reduce disability in long term care [30]. Physical activity and exercise have the
potential to slow the development of disability from poor physical function [31].
</p>

<p class="subhead"> 2.2. Customising off-the-shelf Technology</p>

<p class="body">An
interdisciplinary approach that integrates the knowledge of engineers with
clinicians can enable the development of a virtual reality home-based exercise
programme with off-the-shelf equipment. These systems can be modified to record
the exercise sessions and upload the data to a therapist. As with more
expensive robotic systems, they can be used to record the number of repetitions
and degree of difficulty of a given exercise. A therapist can change the goals
for the patient and observe the patient's adherence from the data recorded. We are
using an interdisciplinary approach to further develop therapy strategies and
test outcomes of home therapy with the aid of off-the-shelf technology.</p>

<p class="body">While
the standard games included with the Wii can be useful for some therapy
programmes, customised games with low risk perturbation (for example sensory
vibration by strapping a Wii controller to the leg) developed for older people
have the potential to be more successful in falls reduction. One benefit of
customised systems is that only the off-the-shelf sensors are required,
significantly reducing system costs. For example, balance exercises using the
Wii balance board or Kinect sensor with customised therapy software can run off
a home computer with no requirement to buy the entire gaming system. Another
benefit is the ability to merge several sensors.  </p>

<h4>3.   Designing Therapy Games</h4>

<p class="body">Nintendo's Wii exercises require the
purchase of a gaming system and balance board (a force platform) at a cost of
$600 whereas customised therapy software only requires the sensors (balance
boards at $200) and can be run using a home computer. Other benefits include the ability to merge several sensors
(multiple balance boards) and the ability to adapt the goals for the
participant or change the goals as the participant progresses. We developed customised
software for two games that can be used with Wii balance boards (force platforms developed by Nintendo
for gaming) and low-risk perturbation (sensory vibration by strapping a Wii
controller to the leg) [32].</p>

<p class="subhead"> 3.1 Labyrinth</p>

<p class="body">Weight shifting exercises have shown that
balance exercises can improve the strength in the users' ankles, knees, and
hips (Winter, 1995) and enhance compensatory strategies. A labyrinth game was
developed that requires the user to shift their centre of pressure (on the
balance board) to manoeuvre a ball into a hole (on a screen).  There are three
main components viewed on the screen by the user while balancing on the Wii
board; the table, the ball and the hole (Figure 1). The table was designed to
tilt in the direction of the user's COP. The tilt angle was dependent on the
distance of the COP from the centre of the board. The ball rolls in the
direction that the table is tilted towards and its magnitude is relative to the
angle of the tilt. The velocity of the ball is determined by the displacement of the
centre of pressure (COP) from the centre of the balance board. The farther the
user shifts their COP, the faster the ball will travel. The direction that the
ball travels is also determined by the direction that the COP is displaced from
the centre of the board.The aim of the
game is for the user to shift their weight to move the pink ball across the
green table into the black hole, while avoiding the white holes (Figure 2).</p>

balance.</figcaption>
</figure>



<p class="body">The game time, best time, total time, and
the score are displayed to the user. Game time is the time to reach the target
hole in the previous trial, while the best time is the fastest time achieved
over the course of the current game. The users can compare the most recent
attempt to the best time as a means to motivate the user to continue. The total
time is the time over which the participant has been playing. The score is a
result of the inverse time to reach the target and extra points if the hole is
sunk in the target hole without the ball touching the edge of the table. </p>

<p class="body">Effort can be
adjusted by changing the difficulty level, the ball size or by adjusting the number
of deceptive holes. Increasing the difficulty level of the game causes the
speed of the ball to increase. The size of the ball can be changed, with the size
of the holes adjusting by the same factor; the larger the target, the greater
the tolerance for error. Lastly, by adjusting the number of deceptive holes the
user is required to be more controlled while shifting their weight to
manipulate the ball into the target hole. </p>

<p class="body">Once the ball sinks into the black hole,
the table is reset with the ball back at its initial position; the middle of
the table. The black hole changes its position to a new random position on the
table. If the ball reaches an edge, it can only move along that edge until the
user tilts the table away from that edge. The ball is not allowed to leave the
table. </p>

<p class="body">The game was designed with the target
audience in mind. It was kept simple so that the user isn't distracted from the
task. The colour scheme was chosen so that there would be no confusion and all
the main components would stand out (but the therapist has flexibility to
change the colours). We used contrasting colours for the table and ball. </p>


<p class="subhead"> 3.1 Stepping Game</p>

<p class="body">With the labyrinth game
focussing on improving a person's strength and ability to maintain balance, we
wanted to create a game that could safely simulate a situation if a person is unable
to keep their centre of pressure and centre of mass in equilibrium. In other
words, we wanted to create an exercise that trains people's third strategy to
prevent falling, that of stepping. </p>

<p class="body">To design this game we used
two balance boards positioned one in front of the other (Figure 3). The participant must stand on the back
board (bottom in the image) and aim to hit the yellow target area on the other
board with the foot shown on the side of the screen (in this case, the right
foot).  If the task is done correctly, the target will turn green. If the
incorrect foot is used, the system alerts the user to the other foot and the
user must step back on to the first board and try again. The user must
correctly step before the system allows them to pass to the next trial. During
this time, the system measures and saves the data from the reaction time (time
to initial movement), the time for the movement, the amount of weight
transferred when stepping as well as the size of step. Both the size and the
location of the target can be randomised as can the amount of weight required
to be shifted to the target location for successful task completion.</p>

</figure>



<p class="body">An added feature of the game was to
evaluate different sensory cues (as one would with a sensory organisation
test).  Vibrational cues could be provided using a Wiimote strapped to each leg
and the rumble functionality. This would provide information about whether an
individual responded more quickly to a tactile input as compared to a visual
input.  Four methods were evaluated including visual cues only, visual cue
before vibration, visual cue after vibration, or presentation of both sensory
inputs simultaneously.</p>

<p class="body">Ethics
approval from the University of Auckland Human Participant Ethics Committee was
obtained to evaluate the games with older participants (&gt;80 years). Usability
questionnaires were completed by all the participants [33] and they ranked the
amount of physical exertion for each game using the Borg Scale of Perceived Exertion.
</p>

<h4>4.   Results</h4>

<p class="body">Five individuals (mean
average age = 81 yrs [standard deviation= 4 yrs], female [n=2], required
walking aids for mobilising on level ground [n=1]) were involved in the initial
pilot test. All participants needed assistance stepping onto the balance boards
at the start of each game and one participant required additional support while
playing the games. One participant used a walking stick for added stability;
the use of the walking stick may have affected the results measured by the
balance boards. Responses to
questionnaires suggest that these games are engaging, particularly the continuous
feedback of success (Figure 4).  </p>

<p class="subhead">4.1 Labyrinth </p>

<p class="body">Participants found the
labyrinth game easy to understand and very usable. Interestingly, when the ball
moved more slowly (the lower difficulty level), participants argued that the
game was more difficult as they had to maintain a specific body position for a
longer period of time. A slightly higher difficulty level allowed them to feel
more comfortable. The participants quickly became bored with only one deceptive
hole and requested additional holes to make the game more challenging. All the
participants said they enjoyed it. They did not show any interest in changing
the colour scheme or ball size or any of the aesthetic aspects of the game.</p>

<p class="body">We found that
some participants would use their arms and full body motions to change the
centre of pressure. This suggests that the participants were no longer focusing
on the balance itself, rather engaging in the game and using whatever
strategies they could to succeed at the game. This will likely to lead to
improved adherence.</p>

<p class="subhead">4.2 Stepping Game</p>

<p class="body">Participants exhibited multiple
mistakes while playing the stepping game. A training session of several "trial
runs" was permitted for the stepping game.  During these, the participant would
often step forward with the wrong foot, step forward with both feet to attempt
to get their COP on the target or dragged their foot across to get the target.
During the test stage, fewer issues were present, though they did still exist.</p>

<p class="body">Participants had difficulty stepping when
the target was closer to the middle of the top balance board. It is known to be
more difficult to maintain balance in tandem stance (one foot in front of the
other) and the participants did not feel as confident exposing themselves to
the risk. The participants also found it hard to relate the image of the top
balance board on the screen with the actual balance board in front of them.
When a target appeared on the screen with the foot indicators, the participants
understood which foot to use but did not pay much attention to the location of
the target. If the left foot was indicated, the participant would step onto the
left part of the board. If the target was instead located closer to the middle,
they had to be reminded that a step in the centre was required.  Some stepped
on with their other foot while some dragged their foot across the board,
causing difficulty for the measurement system.</p>

<p class="body">When different sensory inputs were
introduced, the participants had difficulty responding to the vibration.  A
plot of the results for all participants is shown in Figure 5.  The reaction
time was less variable when presented with only the visual cue, though the
average reaction time was similar among the visual cue only, the visual cue
first, or the visual cue at the same time as the vibration.  When presented
with the vibration first, most participants appeared to wait until the visual
cue was also given before making the step. This suggests that the use of
vibration, at least using the rumble feature of the Wiimote, does not provide
useful information to the user.  Based on this test, it was decided that the
rumble feature would not be used in therapy protocols for the stepping game. </p>

<p class="subhead"> 4.3 General Comments from Initial Pilot Testing</p>


<p class="body">All participants
agreed that they could see themselves using this system in the future and
believed that they would benefit from playing this game for balance
rehabilitation. All participants agreed that the stepping game was more
engaging than typical occupational therapy/physical therapy (OT/PT) that they
had done before and believed that both games were as strenuous as typical OT/PT
they had done previously. In general, the participants found the stepping game
harder to understand and more frustrating to play then that labyrinth game. </p>

<p class="body">Participants were given a
freeform section of the questionnaire to put their comments and included: </p>

<p class="body">"Enjoyed it once
[I] got the idea" </p>

<p class="body">"Once I got used
to this game, very comfortable" </p>

<p class="body">Two of the participants gave
feedback on how the system could be improved: </p>

<p class="body">"Sometimes slow in
indicating which foot" </p>

<p class="body">"Pads a bit wider apart
for me"</p>

<p class="body">The ranking on the
Borg Scale suggested that the Labyrinth game required more exertion than the
stepping game (10.3 versus 9.5 relating to 50%-55% effort), though both
required a fairly light effort.</p>

<p class="subhead"> 4.4 Comments from the Physiotherapists<</p>


<p class="body">The physiotherapists were also given the
opportunity to provide feedback after the session by completing a usability
questionnaire. The purpose of this questionnaire was to gain feedback, from a
physiotherapist's point of view, about the potential for this system and
further recommended developments.</p>

<p class="body">When
commenting on the appropriateness of the games:</p>

<p class="body">"[The
labyrinth game] focused on dynamic balance with ankle, knee and hip strategies
used by participants. I think it was at an appropriate level and was suitably
challenging." </p>

<p class="body">"[The Stepping
game] looked at stepping reaction training; it was very effective for this." </p>

<p class="body">"[The Stepping game] fills a big gap"</p>

<p class="body">When compared to other systems:</p>

<p class="body">"Very
good - portability, cost, usability. I would use it for sure in treating
balance issues for a wide variety of conditions." </p>

<p class="body">"It's great – I
love it. I can definitely see it being very useful in clinical practice" </p>

<p class="body"> Areas
for improvement:</p>

<p class="body">"stepping game needs more emphasis on quick
steps" and noted that </p>

<p class="body">"the vibration feature didn't work so well"</p>

<p class="body">"need feedback in real time"
and perhaps "using the score to complete a task, cumulative scores filling a
cup of tea".</p>

<p class="body">These
comments were used in the next iteration of the design before the following
test occurred.</p>


<p class="subhead"> 4.5 Testing in the Home Environment</p>

<p class="body">One
participant was given the device to test at home for a week. This testing gave
specific insight into implementation difficulties within the home. Two issues
were observed: the
user found it difficult to change of the target size in an attempt to increase
difficulty, while the second related to an error message regarding the laptop
power source which could not be overcome. The participant did not call for
assistance, reporting that it seemed so trivial that he did not want to be a
bother. This supports the need for the system to be extremely stable if it is
to be used in a home environment. It suggests the need for interim follow-up
calls to the participant to ensure that there are no unanticipated problems. It
also suggests that the user needs to be comfortable with being able to contact
the therapist or technician at any time there is a problem, regardless of the
apparently trivial nature of the problem.  </p>

<p class="body">The laptop issue arose after the participant's
first game and stopped any further attempts. Although we hoped to get more
attempts out of this home trial, we were able to get feedback from the one
attempt that was made. Compared to this user's initial questionnaire, there
were notable changes in the one that followed. Five of the questions to which
he had previous answered "Strongly agree" were now reported as "Agree". These
responses in the tester's questionnaire appear to be less enthusiastic than the
previous results. This could be due to the failure of the system. The tester's
Borg scale showed no change at 11, 60% effort (Fairly light). </p>

<h4>5.   Discussion</h4>

<p class="body">Device development that includes user
input is essential to ensure increased usability and acceptance.  Although
iterative design including the users engages them and results in a better
product, there are often obstacles along the way.  Additionally, the process
continues to require iteration to smooth out issues that therapists continue to
experience. The design process is never complete and future developments are
presented below.</p>


<p class="subhead">5.1 Obstacles </p>

<p class="body">Several obstacles were faced - throughout
the development of the system. The first was the difficulty in establishing a
permanent Bluetooth connection between the balance boards and computer. While
this was not insurmountable, careful programming and an understanding of how
the proprietary software functioned was important to understand. In addition,
small bugs within the program itself arose during the development of the system. 
These issues were likely due to the fact that  three people with different
styles of notation worked together on the one program at different times. Other
issues included analysis problems when the user stepped in a way that had not
been anticipated.  For example, if a user stepped to the edge of the board, the
full weight was not recorded and the program had difficulty recognizing what
had occurred.  These issues were only apparent while analyzing the raw data gathered
during pilot testing. These were only identified as a result of having the
actual user population (older people) conducting the testing..</p>

<p class="subhead"> 5.2 Advantages/Disadvantages</p>

<p class="body">In addition to obstacles identified in
the development phases, physiotherapists also commented on the pros and cons of
the system.  For example, the therapists were impressed that the program
required actions appropriate for balance rehabilitation using low cost
technology. By providing therapists and users with information based on their performance,
the opportunity arises to closely monitor and quantify improvements over time. However,
raw data collected while playing the labyrinth game is difficult to quantify
and use to monitor performance due to the random positioning of the targets and
obstacles, as well as the many ways the user can manipulate their center of
pressure to reach any given target. </p>

<p class="subhead"> 5.3 Future Developments</p>


<p class="body">The recommendations of the users and the
therapists have been incorporated into the system. Future development will
continue the iterative design process, working closely with therapists and
older persons who would be potential users of the system. This includes
development of a stand-alone setup to run the system for improved usability
(without the need to have a dedicated computer for running the software).
Overall improvements are also required to ensure both the system and data
analysis process are robust. Finally, we will look to perform rigorous testing
of the system to investigate its capability as both a measurement tool and
therapy tool for balance in older persons.</p>

<h4>6.   Conclusions</h4>

<p class="body">Two games were developed using Wii
balance boards for balance training. These games were shown to be effective
during user testing, though it is important to have a therapist or technician
present during initial use to explain the game (future initial interfaces will
be designed to be more usable).  Initial testing in the home environment
exposed issues that were not present in the laboratory environment which
supports the need for user testing at a very early stage in the prototype
development. Future work will focus on making the interface more usable and the
games more challenging.</p>
