    <p class="body"><b>Abstract</b> - <i>This study examined the frequency of cellphone distraction during face-to-face encounters, comparing rates in men and women. It also assessed whether people report that expression of empathy suffers as a result of cellphone use. Individual differences in annoyance associated with others' attending to their mobile devices were also evaluated. Nearly a third of the young adults surveyed (30%) reported routinely being ignored by their significant other due to mobile device use; only 9% of respondents reported having never been ignored. Roughly half stated that female friends routinely ignore them; nearly as many male friends reportedly did the same. Nearly half (44%) of the respondents reported being bothered by this. About a third of participants admitted that they themselves routinely ignore others during face-to-face encounters due to cellphone use. Personality differences appeared to mediate reactions to cellphone relationship disruption. As expected, perspective-taking was associated with less ignoring of others. Self-esteem seemed to affect perceptions of others' distraction; those higher in self-esteem perceived less interference. Both low self-esteem and depression were associated with greater belief that mobile devices interfere with empathy and greater irritation with others' cellphone use.</i></p>

<h4>1. Introduction</h4>

<p class="body">The modern world provides
constant access to family and friends through the use of mobile devices. Social
networks and text messaging allow people with smart phones to stay current with
the news or contact a friend at a moment's notice.While most see this
technological advancement as something that has improved social interactions among
friends and family members, recently it has been proposed that such 24/7 access
to everyone and everything is actually in some respects detrimental to our geographically
proximate interpersonal relationships.</p>

<p class="body">For many, the problem may be
that constant connection to social media and text messaging can sometimes foster
a disconnection with the <i>real</i> people sitting right in front of us. Face-to-face
interactions with friends and loved ones may become less meaningful because
people are distracted by competing interactions with distant others, through text
messaging or social updates. This could ultimately affect people's
relationships with their closest friends, family, and (especially worrisome) their
significant others, depending upon how much time people spend on their mobile
devices during face-to-face interactions.</p>

<p class="body">Excessive cell phone use may
compromise face-to face interpersonal responsiveness and thereby adversely
affect relationships. Although mobile devices facilitate communication and may
foster the success of some relationships (such as long distance relationships),
they also have potentially deleterious effects on proximate relationships. During
face-to-face encounters, excessive use of mobile devices may interfere with mutuality,
the quality of interpersonal communication, and expressions of empathy. Mobile
devices compete for attention during face-to-face encounters, and recipients of
mobile contacts can be distracted by alerts, whether or not they choose to
respond to incoming texts or calls. This can compromise empathic responding and
be irritating to the onlooker. </p>

<p class="body">An incoming call or message also
creates a quandary for the recipient: should the needs of the distant
communication take precedence over the immediate situation? There are likely
differences in how individuals negotiate these challenges. Trait levels of
empathy might mediate these responses, because sensitivity to others should
elevate the experience of relationship conflict posed by such situations, as
one simultaneously imagines the needs of both the present and the distant
communicator. </p>

<p class="body">Since men and women have been
shown to differ in empathy (Hoffman, 1977), a sex difference in response to
cell phone use might be expected. Women and men may use devices and respond to
others' use of communication technology somewhat differently due to empathy
differences. Additionally, women may have more extensive interpersonal relationships
and feel a greater sense of responsibility within relationships, and
consequently they may find themselves in more frequent mobile contact with
others.</p>

<h4>2. Related Work</h4>

<p class="body">Numerous studies have explored how mobile
devices can foster beneficial connection with friends and family members [9, 14, and 20]. Analysis of
data from 514 phone interviews revealed a positive relationship between cell
phone usage and psychological well-being, mediated by bonding and bridging
social capital [6]. An investigation by Jiang and Hancock (2013) suggested that improved
communication technology is facilitating long distance romantic relationships.
They found that couples
in long- distance relationships have more meaningful interactions than those
who see each other on a daily basis, leading to higher levels of intimacy.</p>

<p class="body">Although Morey, Gentzler,
Creasy, Oberhauser, and Westerman (2013) found use of electronic communication
channels (phone and texting) to be related positively to&nbsp;romantic
relationship&nbsp;quality in their study of 280 young adults, individual
differences in attachment moderated these effects. For instance, texting was
linked to more positive&nbsp;relationships&nbsp;for highly avoidant, but not
less avoidant, participants. Recent
research on gender differences in reactions to mobile technology has yielded
inconsistent results. Lipscomb, Totten, Cook, and Lesch (2007) found no
significant differences between males and females in use of and opinions about
cell phones, whereas Raacke and Bonds-Raacke (2008) found that college women
were more likely to set their profiles to private and log on fewer times per
day than college men. In contrast, Angster et al. (2010) detected no differences between
males and females in frequency of texting, number of cell phone contacts,
frequency of phone calls, or the number of times they check their social
networking sites. Men had fewer friends on social networking sites and more
often had their profiles set to private. Men were also more likely to use
their phones in public, text and call when in line at a store, and text while
conversing with others. </p>

<p class="body">Other
individual differences, such as self-esteem and depressive symptoms, may also
mediate reactions to cellphone technology during face-to-face interactions. Yen,
Tang, Yen, Lin, Huang, Liu, and Ko (2009) noted that adolescents
classified as having significant depression were more likely to engage in
problematic cellular phone use.
Similarly, Ha,
Chin, Park, Ryuve Yu (2008) found higher depressive symptoms among those who
used their phones excessively; they also had greater difficulty expressing
emotions, higher interpersonal anxiety, and lower self-esteem. However, making
phone calls with high frequency appears to lower loneliness in teenagers [19],
although it is associated with greater loneliness in the general population [11].</p>

<p class="body">Since recent
work underscores the importance of interpersonal problems in depression and the
value of improving relationships in reducing depressive symptoms<b>,</b>
clarifying any special sensitivity of depressed or low self-esteem young adults
to mobile device-based interpersonal relationship disruption could be useful
clinically. Previous research has demonstrated that depression is associated
with distinctive interpersonal responses, including reduced empathy following
others' success and failure [3]. Undergraduates with mild depression scored lower
on the Freudenfreude (joy in response to others' joy) scale of the
Freudenfreude and Schadenfreude Test [3]. This lower level of Freudenfreude is
thought to reduce relationship satisfaction, because Freudenfreude is mutually
reinforcing and fosters greater intimacy. In depression, friendships may be
compromised because depressed individuals respond more negatively to peers'
success. Increasing empathic support following another's success
(Freudenfreude) is believed to improve relationships among those with
depression. </p>

<p class="body">Addressing this
Freudenfreude deficit via Interpersonal Mutuality Training (IMT) was shown to
be helpful in both a pre-post effectiveness study [4] and a randomized
controlled trial [5]. The effectiveness study found that ratings of
relationship quality increased following two weeks of IMT for both of the two
designated target relationships identified by the participants. This suggests
that this training worked to enhance relationships. Additionally, depressive
symptom (BDI-II) scores decreased following IMT. This reduction in depressive
symptoms was presumed to be a consequence of enhanced interpersonal
functioning. The efficacy RCT compared IMT with a TAU control, Active Listening
Training (ALT). Ratings of mood and target relationships were better in the
experimental IMT than the ALT group following a 2 week training period. These findings
suggest that enhancing interpersonal relationships can help to improve mood and
ameliorate depression. If mobile technology has the potential to imperil proximate
relationships by reducing empathy, this problem may be especially serious among
those at risk for depression, some of whom may already manifest empathy
deficits. </p>

<h4>3. Method</h4>

<p class="body"><i>Participants</i></p>

<p class="body">The sample consisted of 228
undergraduate volunteers enrolled in an introductory psychology course at a
small, liberal arts college in the mid-Atlantic region of the U.S. (98 male and
130 female students). Students' ages ranged from 18 to 24 years (with a mean
of 18.98 and <i>S.D.</i> of 1.02).</p>

<p class="body"><i>Measures</i></p>

<p class="body">All participants completed a
packet containing the following four paper-and-pencil self-report instruments: The
author-devised Cellphone Relationship Disruption Index (CRDI), which consists
of six 4-point Likert-format items, was used to assess experience with others'
mobile device use during face-to-face encounters, participants' own use, and
participants' subjective response to others' use. Empathy was assessed using
the Davis Interpersonal Reactivity Index [7]. The DIRI is a 28 item
self-report questionnaire. The DIRI contains four subscales measuring fantasy,
perspective taking, empathic concern, and personal distress. Nine of the items
on the DIRI are negatively coded. The 10-item Rosenberg Self Concept Scale [18]
was used to measure self-esteem. Subjects were asked to indicate on a 4-point
Likert scale how strongly they agreed or disagreed with statements assessing
participants' perceptions of their self-worth and competence. Depression was
assessed using the Beck Depression Inventory-II [2]. This self-report measure
contains 21 items scored on a scale of 0 to 3. Each question assesses a
symptom of depressive disorders.</p>

<h4>4. Results</h4>

<p class="body">Does cellphone use often leave
us feeling ignored during face-to-face encounters with our significant other?</p>

<figure>
<img src="002_files/image001.gif" class="article-img">

<figcaption>
Figure 1.</figcaption>
</figure>

<p class="body">Nearly a third of those surveyed
reported routinely being ignored by their significant other. On the other hand,
over two thirds of people reported rarely or never experiencing being ignored. Yet
only 9% of respondents reported never having been ignored by their significant
other due to mobile device use.</p>

<p class="body">Roughly half (52%) of those
surveyed reported that female friends <i>routinely (often or almost always) </i>ignore
them in favor of cell phones and tablets during face-to-face interactions. Only
<b>3% </b>stated that their female friends never ignore them in order to attend
to devices.</p>

<p class="body">Women aren't the only offenders;

</i></b>use cell phones during face-to-face encounters.</p>

<img src="002_files/image003.jpg" class="article-img">

<p class="body">However, some sex differences
emerged as significant. An independent samples t-test revealed a significant
difference in males' and females' perception of females' tendency to use their
cell phone during face-to-face encounters (<i>t</i>= 3.17, <i>df</i>= 217<i>, p</i>=
.002). Women reported greater cellphone distraction in their encounters with
female friends than men did.</p>

<figure>
<img src="002_files/image004.jpg" class="article-img">

<figcaption>
Figure 4.</figcaption>
</figure>

<p class="body">No significant difference in
males' and females' perception of males' cell phone use during face-to-face
encounters was found.</p>

<p class="subhead">4.1. Is Cellphone Use by Others Bothersome?</p>

<p class="body">When participants were asked
about the extent to which others' attending to mobile devices during face-to-face
encounters bothered them, 44.5% of the sample expressed frequent annoyance. A
minority (16%) of respondents reported that they almost always found others'
use of cellphones during encounters to be bothersome.</p>

<p class="subhead">4.2. Does Cellphone
Distraction Compromise Empathy?</p>

<p class="body">Collectively, about half (54%)
of those surveyed often or almost always felt that when their friend was on the
phone while they were together talking that it interfered with the friend's ability
to express empathy. However, 45% of those surveyed indicated that they never or
rarely felt this way.</p>

<p class="subhead">4.3. Acknowledging One's Own Distraction</p>

<p class="body">Over 1/3 of the respondents
admitted to often or almost always paying attention to their cellphone/tablet
during face-to-face encounters with a friend. Half of those surveyed reported
that they only rarely pay attention to their cellphone/tablet when talking to a
friend in person. A minority (7%) of the young adults reported that they <b>never</b>
pay attention to their cellphone/tablet when talking to a friend in person.</p>

<p class="body">There seems to be limited denial
of one's own tendency to be distracted by mobile devices during face-to-face
encounters. Roughly half (50%) of people reported they only rarely pay
attention to their cellphone/tablet when talking to a friend in person.
Consistent with this, roughly half (52%) of those surveyed reported that female
friends routinely ignore them and (43%) reported that their male friends
routinely use cell phones during face-to-face encounters. Participants seemed
to accurately gauge and acknowledge their distraction during face-to-face
encounters.</p>

<p class="subhead">4.4. Individual Differences</p>

<p class="body">Are there individual differences
in perceptions of cellphone interruptions during face-to-face encounters? Are
certain types of people more annoyed when others attend to their mobile
devices? Do certain individuals experience greater relationship disruption due
to cellphone use?</p>

<p class="body">Directionally adjusted items
were totaled to create scores for all participants on the individual difference
variables. Median splits were performed on each variable, yielding low and high
scoring groups for each individual difference characteristic. Independent
samples t-tests were used to compare these low and high scoring groups on the
CRDI items.</p>

<p class="subhead">4.5. Differences
in Perceptions of Cellphone Relationship Disruption between Low and High
Scorers on the Perspective-taking Subscale of the DIRI Empathy Measure</p>

<p class="body">An independent samples t-test
revealed that those who scored low on the perspective taking scale of the DIRI were
more likely to pay attention to their mobile device while friends are talking
to them in person (Low <i>x</i>=2.46, <i>SD</i>=.67 versus High <i>x</i>=2.23, <i>SD</i>=.63;
<i>t</i>=2.46, <i>df</i>=192, <i>p</i>=.01).</p>

<figure>
<img src="002_files/image005.gif" class="article-img">

<figcaption>
Figure 5. </figcaption>
</figure>

<p class="body">No significant associations were
found between scores on the perspective-taking scale and perceptions of men's
or women's mobile device use in face-to-face encounters, or how bothersome or
disruptive such use can be. No other differences related to dimensions of
empathy emerged.</p>

<p class="subhead">4.6. Differences
in Perceptions of Cellphone Relationship Disruption between Low and High
Depression Young Adults</p>

<p class="body">Participants with higher
depression scores on the BDI-II were more likely to perceive that the use of
cell phones and tablets blocks the experience/expression of empathy by their
friends or significant other than those with lower depression. The high
depression participants were also more bothered by such use than their less
depressed peers.</p>

<p class="body">A
trend in the data suggested that participants with high depression were more
bothered by their friends' and significant others' distraction with a cell
phone or tablet during conversation.</p>

<p class="subhead">4.7. Differences
in Perceptions of Cellphone Relationship Disruption between Low and High
Self-esteem Young Adults</p>

<p class="body">Self-esteem affected both
perceptions of others' distraction and its interference with empathy, as well
as the irritation associated with these phenomena. When compared with high
self-esteem peers, those lower in self-esteem felt more ignored and perceived
greater loss of empathy in their relationships as a result of cellphone use. Lower
self-esteem participants also were more bothered by others' cellphone use
during face-to-face encounters.</p>

Discussion</h4>

<p class="body">It is clear from these findings
that a substantial number of young adults have experienced mobile device use as
disruptive in their face-to-face encounters. Distraction seems to be more of a
problem when interacting with women than men, especially for other women.
Various factors could contribute to this. Women may have more extensive social
connections, yielding more opportunities for distraction. They may also value
social communication more than men. Women may believe they are more adroit than
men at social multitasking. Alternatively, women may experience greater
conflict about failing to respond to incoming messages while they are
conversing with others. They may have a greater desire to maintain both the
relationship with the person at the other end of the cell phone and the person
immediately present. This greater conflict or greater fear of recrimination may
explain why women are seen as more likely to disrupt conversations with mobile
device use.</p>

<p class="body">Why might women pay more
attention to their phones when they are with other women? Women may grant each
other more permission for cell phone use (perhaps because women are more
relationship-focused), or at least commonly believe that they do. It is also
possible that women may deprioritize their encounters with same sex friends
more so than men do.</p>

<p class="body">In addition, several personality
dimensions were found to be associated with reactions to cellphone use. Not
surprisingly, perspective-taking was inversely related to one's own use of
mobile devices during face-to-face encounters. Other components of empathy were
not found to be related to mobile device use or perception of others' use.
Depression appeared to enhance vulnerability to relationship disruption tied to
mobile device use. More depressed individuals were more bothered by others'
cellphone use and more likely to feel that devices interfere with expressions
of empathy during face-to-face encounters than less depressed peers. </p>

<p class="body">In contrast, self-esteem seemed
to have a protective effect. Those high in self-esteem seemed more immune to
this problem; they were less bothered than low self-esteem participants,
perceived less frequent disruptions, and did not feel that these distractions
interfered with expressions of empathy. Taken together, it seems that those with
low self-esteem and more symptoms of depression may be especially vulnerable to
this type of social hazard. They may be unusually sensitive to losing others'
attention. Alternatively, it is possible that being critical of others' use of
devices damages relationships and that these resulting relationship problems
may contribute to depression and reduce self-esteem. Depression both
compromises interpersonal relationships and is compounded by poor
relationships. If the hazards to relationships posed by mobile technology are
more pronounced among those prone to depression, clarifying these risks may be
important for both prevention and treatment of depression.</p>

<p class="body">Ironically, while evolving
communication technologies help us feel closer to those who are distant, they
can also psychologically distance us from those who are close by. These
findings indicate that mobile devices often distract listeners during
face-to-face encounters and disrupt expressions of empathy, and that young
adults acknowledge this to be a problem in many of their own intimate
relationships. The results also demonstrate that individual differences have an
important effect on how one experiences the intrusion of mobile devices in proximate
relationships. Realizing how a friend or partner may experience this threat to
empathy differently could help individuals respond more considerately and
sensitively. This could mitigate the potentially disruptive impact of mobile
device use on intimate relationships. Further research using a larger sample
with a more diverse age range, possibly exploring additional individual
differences, could determine the generalizability of these findings and further
clarify these issues. </p>
